       "'\\n\\nUnited States Supreme Court\\nARTIS v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA(2018)\\nNo. 16-460\\nArgued: November 1, 2017Decided: January 22, 2018\\n\\n\\nFederal district courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state claims not otherwise within their adjudicatory authority if those claims are \"part of the same case or controversy\" as the federal claims the plaintiff asserts.  28 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §1367(a).  When a district court dismisses all claims independently qualifying for the exercise of federal jurisdiction, it ordinarily also dismisses all related state claims.  See §1367(c)(3).  Section 1367(d) provides that the \"period of limitations for\" refiling in state court a state claim so dismissed \"shall be tolled while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"  \\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When petitioner Artis filed a federal-court suit against respondent District of Columbia (District), alleging a federal employment-discrimination claim and three allied claims under D.\\xa0C. law, nearly two years remained on the applicable statute of limitations for the D.\\xa0C.-law violations.  Two and a half years later, the Federal District Court ruled against Artis on her sole federal claim and dismissed the D.\\xa0C.-law claims under §1367(c).  Fifty-nine days after the dismissal, Artis refiled her state-law claims in the D.\\xa0C. Superior Court, but that court dismissed them as time barred.  The D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that §1367(d) accorded Artis only a 30-day grace period to refile in state court and rejecting her argument that the word \"tolled\" in §1367(d) means that the limitations period is suspended during the pendency of the federal suit.  \\nHeld: \\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01.\\xa0Section 1367(d)\\'s instruction to \"toll\" a state limitations period means to hold it in abeyance, i.e., to stop the clock.  Pp.\\xa07-16.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(a)\\xa0Statutes that shelter from time bars claims earlier commenced in another forum generally employ one of two means.  First, the period of limitations may be \"tolled,\" i.e., suspended, while the claim is pending elsewhere; the time clock starts running again when the tolling period ends, picking up where it left off.  A legislature may instead elect simply to provide a grace period, permitting the statute of limitations to run while the claim is pending in another forum and averting the risk of a time bar by according the plaintiff a fixed period in which to refile.  The District has identified no federal statute in which a grace-period meaning has been ascribed to the word \"tolled\" or any word similarly rooted.  And the one case in which this Court used tolling language to describe a grace period, see Hardin v. Straub, 490 U.\\xa0S. 536, is a feather on the scale against the weight of decisions in which \"tolling\" a statute of limitations signals stopping the clock.  Pp.\\xa07-11.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(b)\\xa0Considering first the ordinary meaning of the statutory language, §1367(d) is phrased as a tolling provision.  It suspends the statute of limitations both while the claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days postdismissal.  Artis\\' interpretation is a natural fit with this language.  The District, in contrast, reads \"tolled\" to mean to remove, temporarily, the bar that would ordinarily accompany the expiration of the limitations period.  But the District offers no reason to home in only on the word \"tolled\" itself and ignore information about the verb\\'s ordinary meaning gained from its grammatical object, \"period of limitations.\"  That object sheds light on what it means to \"be tolled.\"  The District\\'s reading also tenders a strained interpretation of the phrase \"period of limitations\"; makes the first portion of the tolling period, the duration of the claim\\'s pendency in federal court, superfluous; and could yield an absurdity, permitting a plaintiff to refile in state court even if the limitations period on her claim had expired before she filed in federal court.  Pp.\\xa011-13.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(c)\\xa0The D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Congress adopted an American Law Institute (ALI) recommendation to allow refiling in state court only for 30 days after a dismissal.  The ALI provision, like §1367(d), established a 30-day federal floor on the time allowed for refiling, but it did not provide for tolling \"while the [state] claim is pending\" in federal court.  Pp.\\xa013-14.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(d)\\xa0The 30-day provision casts no large shadow on Artis\\' stop-the-clock interpretation.  The provision accounts for cases in which a plaintiff commenced a federal action close to the expiration date of the relevant state statute of limitations, by giving such a plaintiff breathing space to refile in state court.  Adding a brief span of days to the tolling period is not unusual in stop-the-clock statutes.  See, e.g., 46 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §53911.  Section 1367(d)\\'s proviso \"unless State law provides for a longer tolling period\" could similarly aid a plaintiff who filed in federal court just short of the expiration of the state limitations period.  Pp.\\xa014-16.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02.\\xa0The stop-the-clock interpretation of §1367(d) does not present a serious constitutional problem.  In Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U.\\xa0S. 456, the Court rejected an argument that §1367(d) impermissibly exceeds Congress\\' authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Id., at 464-465.  The District contends that a stop-the-clock prescription serves \"no federal purpose\" that could not be served by a grace-period prescription.  But both devices are standard, off-the-shelf means of accounting for the fact that a claim was timely pressed in another forum.  Requiring Congress to choose one over the other would impose a tighter constraint on Congress\\' discretion than this Court has countenanced.  A concern that a stop-the-clock prescription entails a greater imposition on the States than a grace-period prescription may also be more theoretical than real.  Finally, a stop-the-clock rule like §1367(d) is suited to the primary purposes of limitations statutes: \"\\xa0\\'preventing surprises\\'\\xa0\" to defendants and \"\\xa0\\'barring a plaintiff who has slept on his rights.\\'\\xa0\"  American Pipe & Constr.

ARTIS, PETITIONER v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\\non writ of certiorari to the district of columbia court of appeals\\n[January 22, 2018]\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Supplemental Jurisdiction statute, 28 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §1367, enables federal district courts to entertain claims not otherwise within their adjudicatory authority when those claims \"are so related to claims .\\xa0.\\xa0. within [federal-court competence] that they form part of the same case or controversy.\"  §1367(a).  Included within this supplemental jurisdiction are state claims brought along with federal claims arising from the same episode.  When district courts dismiss all claims independently qualifying for the exercise of federal jurisdiction, they ordinarily dismiss as well all related state claims.  See §1367(c)(3).  A district court may also dismiss the related state claims if there is a good reason to decline jurisdiction.  See §1367(c)(1), (2), and (4).  This case concerns the time within which state claims so dismissed may be refiled in state court.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Section 1367(d), addressing that issue, provides:\\n\"The period of limitations for any [state] claim [\\xa0joined with a claim within federal-court competence] shall be tolled while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"\\nThe question presented: Does the word \"tolled,\" as used in §1367(d), mean the state limitations period is suspended during the pendency of the federal suit; or does \"tolled\" mean that, although the state limitations period continues to run, a plaintiff is accorded a grace period of 30 days to refile in state court post dismissal of the federal case?  Petitioner urges the first, or stop-the-clock, reading.  Respondent urges, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals adopted, the second, or grace-period, reading.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the case before us, plaintiff-petitioner Stephanie C. Artis refiled her state-law claims in state court 59 days after dismissal of her federal suit.1  Reading §1367(d) as a grace-period prescription, her complaint would be time barred.  Reading §1367(d) as stopping the limitations clock during the pendency of the federal-court suit, her complaint would be timely.  We hold that §1367(d)\\'s instruction to \"toll\" a state limitations period means to hold it in abeyance, i.e., to stop the clock.  Because the D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals held that §1367(d) did not stop the D.\\xa0C. Code\\'s limitations clock, but merely provided a 30-day grace period for refiling in D.\\xa0C. Superior Court, we reverse the D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals\\' judgment.\\nI\\nA\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Section 1367, which Congress added to Title 28 as part of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 5089, codifies the court-developed pendent and ancillary jurisdiction doctrines under the label \"supplemental jurisdiction.\"  See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U.\\xa0S. 546, 552-558 (2005) (describing the development of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction doctrines and subsequent enactment of §1367); id., at 579-584 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (same).  The House Report accompanying the Act explains that Congress sought to clarify the scope of federal courts\\' authority to hear claims within their supplemental jurisdiction, appreciating that \"[s]upplemental jurisdiction has enabled federal courts and litigants to .\\xa0.\\xa0. deal economically--in single rather than multiple litigation--with related matters.\"  H.\\xa0R. Rep. No. 101-734, p. 28 (1990) (H.\\xa0R. Rep.).  Section 1367(a) provides, in relevant part, that a district court with original jurisdiction over a claim \"shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims .\\xa0.\\xa0. form[ing] part of the same case or controversy.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \"[N]ot every claim within the same \\'case or controversy\\' as the claim within the federal courts\\' original jurisdiction will be decided by the federal court.\"  Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U.\\xa0S. 456, 459 (2003).  Section 1367(c) states:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if--\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"(3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\"(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0If a district court declines to exercise jurisdiction over a claim asserted under §1367(a) and the plaintiff wishes to continue pursuing it, she must refile the claim in state court.  If the state court would hold the claim time barred, however, then, absent a curative provision, the district court\\'s dismissal of the state-law claim without prejudice would be tantamount to a dismissal with prejudice.  See, e.g., Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.\\xa0S. 343, 352 (1988) (under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, if the statute of limitations on state-law claims expires before the federal court \"relinquish[es] jurisdiction[,] .\\xa0.\\xa0. a dismissal will foreclose the plaintiff from litigating his claims\").  To prevent that result, §1367(d) supplies \"a tolling rule that must be applied by state courts.\"  Jinks, 538 U.\\xa0S., at 459.  Section 1367(d) provides:\\n\"The period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a), and for any other claim in the same action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or after the dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"\\nThis case requires us to determine how §1367(d)\\'s tolling rule operates.\\nB\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Petitioner Artis worked as a health inspector for respondent, the District of Columbia (the \"District\").  In November 2010, Artis was told she would lose her job.  Thirteen months later, Artis sued the District in the  United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that she had suffered employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §2000e et\\xa0seq.  She also asserted three allied claims under D.\\xa0C. law: retaliation in violation of the District of Columbia Whistleblower Act, D.\\xa0C. Code §1-615.54 (2001); termination in violation of the District of Columbia False Claims Act, §2-381.04; and wrongful termination against public policy, a common-law claim.  Artis alleged that she had been subjected to gender discrimination by her supervisor, and thereafter encountered retaliation for reporting the supervisor\\'s unlawful activities.  See Artis v. District of Columbia, 51 F.\\xa0Supp. 3d 135, 137 (2014).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On June 27, 2014, the District Court granted the District\\'s motion for summary judgment on the Title VII claim.  Having dismissed Artis\\' sole federal claim, the District Court, pursuant to §1367(c)(3), declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her remaining state-law claims.  \"Artis will not be prejudiced,\" the court noted, \"because 28 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §1367(d) provides for a tolling of the statute of limitations during the period the case was here and for at least 30 days thereafter.\"  Id., at 142.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Fifty-nine days after the dismissal of her federal action, Artis refiled her state-law claims in the D.\\xa0C. Superior Court, the appropriate local court.  The Superior Court granted the District\\'s motion to dismiss, holding that Artis\\' claims were time barred, because they were filed 29 days too late.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a.  When Artis first asserted her state-law claims in the District Court, nearly two years remained on the applicable three-year statute of limitations.2  But two and a half years passed before the federal court relinquished jurisdiction.  Unless §1367(d) paused the limitations clock during that time, Artis would have had only 30 days to refile.  The Superior Court rejected Artis\\' stop-the-clock reading of §1367(d), reasoning that Artis could have protected her state-law claims by \"pursuing [them] in a state court while the federal court proceeding [was] pending.\"  Ibid.  In tension with that explanation, the court noted that duplicative filings in federal and state court are \"generally disfavored .\\xa0.\\xa0. as \\'wasteful\\' and .\\xa0.\\xa0. \\'against [the interests of] judicial efficiency.\\'\\xa0\"  Id., at 14a, n.\\xa01 (quoting Stevens v. Arco Management of Wash. D.C., Inc., 751 A.\\xa02d 995, 1002 (D.\\xa0C. 2000); alteration in original).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals affirmed.  That court began by observing that two \"competing approaches [to §1367(d)] have evolved nationally\": the stop-the-clock reading and the grace-period reading.  135 A.\\xa03d 334, 337 (2016).3  Without further comment on §1367(d)\\'s text, the D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals turned to the legislative history.  Section 1367(d)\\'s purpose, the court noted, was \"to prevent the loss of claims to statutes of limitations where state law might fail to toll the running of the period of limitations while a supplemental claim was pending in federal court.\"  Id., at 338 (quoting H.\\xa0R. Rep., at 30; internal quotation marks omitted).  Following the lead of the California Supreme Court, the D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals determined that Congress had intended to implement a 1969 recommendation by the American Law Institute (ALI) to allow refiling in state court \"within 30 days after dismissal.\"  135 A.\\xa03d, at 338 (quoting Los Angeles v. County of Kern, 59 Cal. 4th 618, 629, 328 P.\\xa03d 56, 63 (2014)).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals also concluded that the grace-period approach \"better accommodates federalism concerns,\" by trenching significantly less on state statutes of limitations than the stop-the-clock approach.  135 A. 3d, at 338-339.  Construing §1367(d) as affording only a 30-day grace period, the court commented, was \"consistent with [its] presumption favoring narrow interpretations of federal preemption of state law.\"  Id., at 339.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To resolve the division of opinion among State Supreme Courts on the proper construction of §1367(d), see supra, at 6, n.\\xa03, we granted certiorari.  580 U.\\xa0S. ___ (2017).\\nII\\nA\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As just indicated, statutes that shelter from time bars claims earlier commenced in another forum generally employ one of two means.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0First, the period (or statute) of limitations may be \"tolled\" while the claim is pending elsewhere.4  Ordinarily, \"tolled,\" in the context of a time prescription like §1367(d), means that the limitations period is suspended (stops running) while the claim is sub judice elsewhere, then starts running again when the tolling period ends, picking up where it left off.  See Black\\'s Law Dictionary 1488 (6th ed. 1990) (\"toll,\" when paired with the grammatical object \"statute of limitations,\" means \"to suspend or stop temporarily\").  This dictionary definition captures the rule generally applied in federal courts.  See, e.g., Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U.\\xa0S. 650, 652, n. 1 (1983) (Court\\'s opinion \"use[d] the word \\'tolling\\' to mean that, during the relevant period, the statute of limitations ceases to run\").5  Our decisions employ the terms \"toll\" and \"suspend\" interchangeably.  For example, in American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974), we characterized as a \"tolling\" prescription a rule \"suspend[ing] the applicable statute of limitations,\" id., at 554; accordingly, we applied the rule to stop the limitations clock, id., at 560-561.6  We have similarly comprehended what tolling means in decisions on equitable tolling.  See, e.g., CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573 U.\\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7) (describing equitable tolling as \"a doctrine that pauses the running of, or \\'tolls\\' a statute of limitations\" (some internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Ibarra, 502 U.\\xa0S. 1, 4, n. 2 (1991) (\\xa0per curiam) (\"Principles of equitable tolling usually dictate that when a time bar has been suspended and then begins to run again upon a later event, the time remaining on the clock is calculated by subtracting from the full limitations period whatever time ran before the clock was stopped.\").\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In lieu of \"tolling\" or \"suspending\" a limitations period by pausing its progression, a legislature might elect simply to provide a grace period.  When that mode is adopted, the statute of limitations continues to run while the claim is pending in another forum.  But the risk of a time bar is averted by according the plaintiff a fixed period in which to refile.  A federal statute of that genre is 28 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §2415.  That provision prescribes a six-year limitations period for suits seeking money damages from the United States for breach of contract.  §2415(a).  The statute further provides: \"In the event that any action .\\xa0.\\xa0. is timely brought and is thereafter dismissed without prejudice, the action may be recommenced within one year after such dismissal, regardless of whether the action would otherwise then be barred by this section.\"  §2415(e).7  Many States have enacted similar grace-period provisions.  See App. to Brief for National Conference of State Legislatures et\\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 1a-25a.  For example, Georgia law provides:\\n\"When any case has been commenced in either a state or federal court within the applicable statute of limitations and the plaintiff discontinues or dismisses the same, it may be recommenced in a court of this state or in a federal court either within the original applicable period of limitations or within six months after the discontinuance or dismissal, whichever is later .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.\"  Ga. Code Ann. §9-2-61(a) (2007).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Tellingly, the District has not identified any federal statute in which a grace-period meaning has been ascribed to the word \"tolled\" or any word similarly rooted.  Nor has the dissent, for all its mighty strivings, identified even one federal statute that fits its bill, i.e., a federal statute that says \"tolled\" but means something other than \"suspended,\" or \"paused,\" or \"stopped.\"  From what statutory text, then, does the dissent start?  See post, at 5.8 \\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Turning from statutory texts to judicial decisions, only once did an opinion of this Court employ tolling language to describe a grace period: Hardin v. Straub, 490 U.\\xa0S. 536 (1989).  In Hardin, we held that, in 42 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §1983 suits, federal courts should give effect to state statutes sheltering claims from time bars during periods of a plaintiff\\'s legal disability.  We there characterized a state statute providing a one-year grace period as \"tolling\" or \"suspend[ing]\" the limitations period \"until one year after the disability has been removed.\"  490 U.\\xa0S., at 537.  This atypical use of \"tolling\" or \"suspending\" to mean something other than stopping the clock on a limitations period is a feather on the scale against the weight of decisions in which \"tolling\" a statute of limitations signals stopping the clock.\\nB\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In determining the meaning of a statutory provision, \"we look first to its language, giving the words used their ordinary meaning.\"  Moskal v. United States, 498 U.\\xa0S. 103, 108 (1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Section 1367(d) is phrased as a tolling provision.  It suspends the statute of limitations for two adjacent time periods: while the claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days postdismissal.  Artis urges that the phrase \"shall be tolled\" in §1367(d) has the same meaning it does in the statutes cited supra, at 7, n.\\xa04.  That is, the limitations clock stops the day the claim is filed in federal court and, 30 days postdismissal, restarts from the point at which it had stopped.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The District reads \"tolled\" for §1367(d)\\'s purposes differently.  To \"toll,\" the District urges, means to \"remove or take away an effect.\"  Brief for Respondent 12-13.  To \"toll\" a limitations period, then, would mean to \"remov[e] the bar that ordinarily would accompany its expiration.\"  Id., at 14.9  \"[T]here is nothing special,\" the District maintains, \"about tolling limitations periods versus tolling any other fact, right, or consequence.\"  Id., at 13.  But the District offers no reason why, in interpreting \"tolled\" as used in §1367(d), we should home in only on the word itself, ignoring the information about the verb\\'s ordinary meaning gained from its grammatical object.  Just as when the object of \"tolled\" is \"bell\" or \"highway traveler,\" the object \"period of limitations\" sheds light on what it means to \"be tolled.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The District\\'s reading, largely embraced by the dissent, is problematic for other reasons as well.  First, it tenders a strained interpretation of the phrase \"period of limitations.\"  In the District\\'s view, \"period of limitations\" means \"the effect of the period of limitations as a time bar.\"  See id., at 18 (\"Section 1367(d) .\\xa0.\\xa0. provides that \\'the period of limitations\\'--here its effect as a time bar--\\'shall be [removed or taken away] while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed.\\'\\xa0\" (alterations in original)).  Second, the first portion of the tolling period, the duration of the claim\\'s pendency in federal court, becomes superfluous under the District\\'s construction.  The \"effect\" of the limitations period as a time bar, on the District\\'s reading, becomes operative only after the case has been dismissed.  That being so, what need would there be to remove anything while the claim is pending in federal court?\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Furthermore, the District\\'s reading could yield an absurdity: It could permit a plaintiff to refile in state court even if the limitations period on her claim had expired before she filed in federal court.  To avoid that result, the District\\'s proposed construction of \"tolled\" as \"removed\" could not mean simply \"removed.\"  Instead, \"removed\" would require qualification to express \"removed, unless the period of limitations expired before the claim was filed in federal court.\"  In sum, the District\\'s interpretation maps poorly onto the language of §1367(d), while Artis\\' interpretation is a natural fit.\\nC\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals adopted the District\\'s grace-period construction primarily because it was convinced that in drafting §1367(d), Congress embraced an ALI recommendation.  135 A.\\xa03d, at 338.  Two decades before the enactment of §1367(d), the ALI, in its 1969 Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, did recommend a 30-day grace period for refiling certain claims.  The ALI proposed the following statutory language:\\n\"If any claim in an action timely commenced in a federal court is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim, a new action on the same claim brought in another court shall not be barred by a statute of limitations that would not have barred the original action had it been commenced in that court, if such new action is brought in a proper court, federal or State, within thirty days after dismissal of the original claim has become final or within such longer period as may be available under applicable State law.\"  ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts §1386(b), p. 65 (1969) (ALI Study).\\nCongress, however, did not adopt the ALI\\'s grace-period formulation.  Instead, it ordered tolling of the state limitations period \"while the claim is pending\" in federal court.  Although the provision the ALI proposed, like §1367(d), established a 30-day federal floor on the time allowed for refiling, it did not provide for tolling the period of limitations while a claim is pending.10  True, the House Report contained a citation to the ALI Study, but only in reference to a different provision, 28 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §1391 (the general venue statute).  There, Congress noted that its approach was \"taken from the ALI Study.\"  H.\\xa0R. Rep., at 23.  Had Congress similarly embraced the ALI\\'s grace-period formulation in §1367(d), one might expect the House Report to have said as much.11\\nD\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The District asks us to zero in on §1367(d)\\'s \"express inclusion\" of the \"period of 30 days after the claim is dismissed\" within the tolling period.  Brief for Respondent 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under Artis\\' stop-the-clock interpretation, the District contends, \"the inclusion of 30 days within the tolling period would be relegated to insignificance in the mine-run of cases.\"  Id., at 21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  In §1367(d), Congress did provide for tolling not only while the claim is pending in federal court, but also for 30 days thereafter.  Including the 30 days within §1367(d)\\'s tolling period accounts for cases in which a federal action is commenced close to the expiration date of the relevant state statute of limitations.  In such a case, the added days give the plaintiff breathing space to refile in state court.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Adding a brief span of days to the tolling period is not unusual in stop-the-clock statutes.  In this respect, §1367(d) closely resembles 46 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §53911, which provides, in a subsection titled \"Tolling of limitations period,\" that if a plaintiff submits a claim for war-related vessel damage to the Secretary of Transportation, \"the running of the limitations period for bringing a civil action is suspended until the Secretary denies the claim, and for 60 days thereafter.\"  §53911(d).  Numerous other statutes similarly append a fixed number of days to an initial tolling period.  See, e.g., 22 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §1631k(c) (\"Statutes of limitations on assessments .\\xa0.\\xa0. shall be suspended with respect to any vested property .\\xa0.\\xa0. while vested and for six months thereafter.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.\"); 26 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §6213(f\\xa0)(1) (\"In any case under title 11 of the United States Code, the running of the time prescribed by subsection (a) for filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to any deficiency shall be suspended for the period during which the debtor is prohibited by reason of such case from filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to such deficiency, and for 60 days thereafter.\"); §6503(a)(1) (\"The running of the period of limitations provided in section 6501 or 6502 .\\xa0.\\xa0. shall .\\xa0.\\xa0. be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the assessment .\\xa0.\\xa0. and for 60 days thereafter.\"); 50 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §4000(c) (\"The running of a statute of limitations against the collection of tax deferred under this section .\\xa0.\\xa0. shall be suspended for the period of military service of the servicemember and for an additional period of 270 days thereafter.\").  Thus, the \"30 days\" provision casts no large shadow on Artis\\' interpretation.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Section 1367(d)\\'s proviso, \"unless State law provides for a longer tolling period,\" could similarly aid a plaintiff who filed in federal court just short of the expiration of the state limitations period.  She would have the benefit of §1367(d)\\'s 30-days-to-refile prescription, or such longer time as state law prescribes.12  It may be that, in most cases, the state-law tolling period will not be longer than §1367(d)\\'s.  But in some cases it undoubtedly will.  For example, Indiana permits a plaintiff to refile within three years of dismissal.  See Ind. Code §34-11-8-1 (2017).  And Louisiana provides that after dismissal the limitations period \"runs anew.\"  La. Civ. Code Ann., Arts. 3462, 3466 (West 2007).\\nIII\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Satisfied that Artis\\' text-based arguments overwhelm the District\\'s, we turn to the District\\'s contention that the stop-the-clock interpretation of §1367(d) raises a significant constitutional question: Does the statute exceed Congress\\' authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art.\\xa0I, §8, cl. 18, because its connection to Congress\\' enumerated powers is too attenuated or because it is too great an incursion on the States\\' domain?  Brief for Respondent 46-49.  To avoid constitutional doubt, the District urges, we should adopt its reading.  \"[W]here an alternative interpretation of [a] statute is fairly possible,\" the District reminds, we have construed legislation in a manner that \"avoid[s] [serious constitutional] problems\" raised by \"an otherwise acceptable construction.\"  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.\\xa0S. 289, 299-300 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But even if we regarded the District\\'s reading of §1367(d) as \"fairly possible,\" our precedent would undermine the proposition that §1367(d) presents a serious constitutional problem.  See Jinks, 538 U.\\xa0S., at 461-465.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In Jinks, we unanimously rejected an argument that §1367(d) impermissibly exceeds Congress\\' enumerated powers.13  Section 1367(d), we held, \"is necessary and proper for carrying into execution Congress\\'s power \\'[t]o constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court,\\' .\\xa0.\\xa0. and to assure that those tribunals may fairly and efficiently exercise \\'[t]he judicial Power of the United States.\\'\\xa0\"  Id., at 462 (quoting U.\\xa0S. Const., Art.\\xa0I, §8, cl.\\xa09, and Art.\\xa0III, §1).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In two principal ways, we explained, §1367(d) is \"conducive to the due administration of justice in federal court.\"  538 U.\\xa0S., at 462 (internal quotation marks omitted).  First, \"it provides an alternative to the unsatisfactory options that federal judges faced when they decided whether to retain jurisdiction over supplemental state-law claims that might be time barred in state court.\"  Ibid.  Section 1367(d) thus \"unquestionably promotes fair and efficient operation of the federal courts.\"  Id., at 463.  Second, §1367(d) \"eliminates a serious impediment to access to the federal courts on the part of plaintiffs pursuing federal- and state-law claims\" arising from the same episode.  Ibid.  With tolling available, a plaintiff disinclined to litigate simultaneously in two forums is no longer impelled to choose between forgoing either her federal claims or her state claims.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Moreover, we were persuaded that §1367(d) was \"plainly adapted\" to Congress\\' exercise of its enumerated power: there was no cause to suspect that Congress had enacted §1367(d) as a \"\\xa0\\'pretext\\' for \\'the accomplishment of objects not entrusted to [it],\\'\\xa0\"; nor was there reason to believe that the connection between §1367(d) and Congress\\' authority over the federal courts was too attenuated.  Id., at 464 (quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 423 (1819)).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our decision in Jinks also rejected the argument that §1367(d) was not \"proper\" because it violates principles of state sovereignty by prescribing a procedural rule for state courts\\' adjudication of purely state-law claims.  538 U.\\xa0S., at 464-465.  \"Assuming [without deciding] that a principled dichotomy can be drawn, for purposes of determining whether an Act of Congress is \\'proper,\\' between federal laws that regulate state-court \\'procedure\\' and laws that change the \\'substance\\' of state-law rights of action,\" we concluded that the tolling of state limitations periods \"falls on the [permissible] \\'substantive\\' side of the line.\"  Ibid.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The District\\'s contention that a stop-the-clock prescription serves \"no federal purpose\" that could not be served by a grace-period prescription is unavailing.  Brief for Respondent 49.  Both devices are standard, off-the-shelf means of accounting for the fact that a claim was timely pressed in another forum.  Requiring Congress to choose one over the other would impose a tighter constraint on Congress\\' discretion than we have ever countenanced.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The concern that a stop-the-clock prescription entails a greater imposition on the States than a grace-period prescription, moreover, may be more theoretical than real.  Consider the alternative suggested by the D.\\xa0C. Superior Court.  Plaintiffs situated as Artis was could simply file two actions and ask the state court to hold the suit filed there in abeyance pending disposition of the federal suit.  See supra, at 6.  Were the dissent\\'s position to prevail, cautious plaintiffs would surely take up the D.\\xa0C. Superior Court\\'s suggestion.  How it genuinely advances federalism concerns to drive plaintiffs to resort to wasteful, inefficient duplication to preserve their state-law claims is far from apparent.  See, e.g., Stevens, 751 A.\\xa02d, at 1002 (it \"work[s] against judicial efficiency .\\xa0.\\xa0. to compel prudent federal litigants who present state claims to file duplicative and wasteful protective suits in state court\").\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We do not gainsay that statutes of limitations are \"fundamental to a well-ordered judicial system.\"  Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U.\\xa0S. 478, 487 (1980).  We note in this regard, however, that a stop-the-clock rule is suited to the primary purposes of limitations statutes: \"preventing surprises\" to defendants and \"barring a plaintiff who has slept on his rights.\"  American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.\\xa0S. 538, 554 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Whenever §1367(d) applies, the defendant will have notice of the plaintiff\\'s claims within the state-prescribed limitations period.  Likewise, the plaintiff will not have slept on her rights.  She will have timely asserted those rights, endeavoring to pursue them in one litigation.\\n*\\u2003\\u2003*\\u2003\\u2003*\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0For the reasons stated, we resist unsettling the usual understanding of the word \"tolled\" as it appears in legislative time prescriptions and court decisions thereon.  The judgment of the D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\\n\\u2002583 U.\\xa0S. ____ (2018)\\nNo. 16-460\\nSTEPHANIE C. ARTIS, PETITIONER v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\\non writ of certiorari to the district of columbia court of appeals\\n[January 22, 2018]\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito join, dissenting.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Chesterton reminds us not to clear away a fence just because we cannot see its point.  Even if a fence doesn\\'t seem to have a reason, sometimes all that means is we need to look more carefully for the reason it was built in the first place.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The same might be said about the law before us.  Section 1367(d) provides that \"[t]he period of limitations .\\xa0.\\xa0. shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"  28 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §1367(d).  Grown from a rich common law and state statutory tradition, this provision serves a modest role.  If a federal court dismisses a party\\'s state law claim without ruling on its merits, the law ensures the party will enjoy whatever time state law allows, or at least 30 days, to refile the claim in state court.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Today the Court clears away this traditional rule because it overlooks the original reasons for it.  For the first time in the statute\\'s history the Court now reads the law to guarantee parties not 30 days or whatever state law permits but months or years more to refile their dismissed state law claims in state court.  Rather than reading the statute as generally deferring to state law judgments about the appropriate lifespan of state law claims brought in state courts, the Court now reads the statute as generally displacing them in favor of a new federal rule.  Indeed, the Court today tells state courts that they must routinely disregard clearly expressed state law defining the appropriate length of time parties should have to sue on state law claims in state tribunals.  Under the Court\\'s rule, too, the disregard of state limitations law promises to be not only routine but substantial.  The Court\\'s approach will require state courts to entertain state law claims that state law deems untimely not only by weeks or months but by many years, as 24 States, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments warn us.  And the Court demands all this without offering any rational account why it is necessary or proper to the exercise of one of the federal government\\'s limited and enumerated powers.  It may only be a small statute we are interpreting, but the result the Court reaches today represents no small intrusion on traditional state functions and no small departure from our foundational principles of federalism.  Respectfully, I dissent.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Start with the statute\\'s key term.  Where, as here, a law instructs us to \"toll\" a limitations period, we know it may be telling us to do one of (at least) two different things.  The dictionary informs that to \"toll\" means \"[t]o take away, bar, defeat, [or] annul.\"  See 18 Oxford English Dictionary 204 (2d ed. 1989); Webster\\'s New International Dictionary 2662 (2d ed. 1957) (\"[t]o take away; to vacate; to annul\"); Oxford Latin Dictionary 1947 (1982) (\"tollere,\" the Latin origin, means to \"remove\" or \"lift\").  So when a statute speaks of tolling a limitations period it can, naturally enough, mean either that the running of the limitations period is suspended or that the effect of the limitations period is defeated.  The first understanding stops the limitations clock running until a specified event begins it running again: call it the stop clock approach.  The second understanding allows the limitations clock to continue to run but defeats the effect of the clock\\'s expiration for an additional specified period of time: call it the grace period approach.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That both of these understandings of the word \"toll\" are indeed possible and in fact historically common this Court has already explained in Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U.\\xa0S. 650 (1983):\\n\"\\xa0\\'Tolling effect\\' refers to the method of calculating the amount of time available to file suit after tolling has ended.  The statute of limitations might merely be suspended; if so, the plaintiff must file within the amount of time left in the limitations period.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.  It is also possible to establish a fixed period such as six months or one year during which the plaintiff may file suit, without regard to the length of the original limitations period or the amount of time left when tolling began.\"  Id., at 652, n.\\xa01 (emphasis added).\\nWhen it comes to federal law today, Chardon has further explained, both kinds of tolling can be found.  \"[S]ome federal statutes provide for suspension\" of the running of the limitations period, or the stop clock approach, while \"other statutes establish a variety of different tolling effects,\" including grace periods for refiling after dismissal.  Id., at 660, n. 13.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Neither is it a surprise that Chardon acknowledged tolling statutes might come in (at least) these two varieties.  At common law, both types of tolling were well and long known, if often employed in different circumstances to address different problems in equitably tailored ways.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Take the stop clock approach.  While any generalization is subject to its exceptions, the stop clock approach was often used at common law to suspend a plaintiff\\'s duty to bring a timely lawsuit if, and for the period, the plaintiff was prevented from coming to court due to some disability.  And this common law rule made common sense in those circumstances.  After all, if (say) a defendant\\'s fraud prevented the plaintiff from discovering his injury, it\\'s easy enough to see why the limitations clock should stop running until the fraud is revealed and the disability thus dissipated.1\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0By contrast, the grace period approach was commonly used in cases where, as here, the plaintiff made it to court in time but arrived in the wrong court and had to refile in the right one.  In this situation, equity didn\\'t necessarily call for suspending the running of the limitations period for whatever arbitrary period of time--weeks or months or years--the suit happened to sit in court before dismissal.  It\\'s not as if the defendant or uncontrollable circumstances had conspired to prevent the plaintiff from proceeding during that period.  Instead, the law commonsensically held that in these circumstances a grace period would suffice to allow the plaintiff a brief time to find his way to and refile in the correct court.2\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Indeed, grace periods appear to find their roots in a common law rule known as the \"journey\\'s account\" that expressly sought to account for and afford to a dismissed party \"the number of days which [he] must spend in journeying to the court\" to refile his claim.  37 C.\\xa0J., Limitations of Actions §526, p. 1082 (1925); see E. Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 567 (1642) (reprint 1797) (\"[T]he common law set downe the certaine time of 15 dayes,\" because \"a dayes journey is accounted in law 20 miles,\" as \"a  reasonable time .\\xa0.\\xa0. within which time wheresoever the court of justice sate in England, the party .\\xa0.\\xa0. wheresoever he dwelt in England .\\xa0.\\xa0. might .\\xa0.\\xa0. by the said account of dayes journies appeare in court\"); Spencer\\'s Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 267, 267-268 (1603) (party has \"the benefit of a new writ by journeys accompts\" after first writ \"abated\"); Elstob v. Thorowgood, 91 Eng. Rep. 1086, 1087 (1697) (party has 30 days to bring an action \"by journeys account\" to avoid \"the Statute of Limitations\").\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When it comes to the statute before us, the textual and contextual clues point in the same and unsurprising direction.  Much like the journey\\'s account from which it originated, section 1367(d)\\'s \"tolling\" provision seeks to provide the plaintiff who finds her case dismissed because she filed in the wrong court a reasonable grace period to journey to the right court to refile.  No more and no less.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Take the textual clues.  Section 1367(d) says that \"the period of limitations .\\xa0.\\xa0. shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"  Note that the law uses the words \"tolled\" and \"tolling\" in the same sentence.  Normally, we assume that when Congress repeats a term in a statute the term\\'s meaning remains constant throughout.  And that assumption is surely \"at its most vigorous\" where, as here, Congress repeats the same term in the same sentence.  Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.\\xa0S. 115, 118 (1994).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This traditional rule of construction tells us a great deal. It does because no one doubts that the state law \"tolling period[s]\" referenced in the second half of the sentence were at the time of section 1367(d)\\'s enactment--and still are--grace periods allowing parties a specified number of days or months after dismissal to refile in the proper court.  See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. §13-80-111 (1990) (providing that the plaintiff \"may commence a new action upon the same cause of action within ninety days after the termination of the original action\").3  In fact, these statutes were often self-consciously patterned on the journey\\'s account doctrine, seeking to address much the same problem the common law faced with much the same solution.4  And the fact that Congress used a variant of the word \"toll\" in the second half of the sentence to refer to grace periods strongly suggests it did so in the first half of the sentence too.  So that the first phrase \"shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days\" should be understood to extend a grace period of 30 days after dismissal much as the second phrase \"tolling period\" is understood to refer the reader to parallel state law grace periods affording short periods for refiling after dismissal.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The alternative reading endorsed by the Court today extends too little respect to Congress\\'s competency as drafter.  It asks us to assume the legislature was so garbled in its expression that it switched the meaning of the term \"toll\" halfway through a single sentence without telling anyone.  It asks us to conclude that when Congress spoke of the period \"tolled\" in the first part of the sentence it meant to refer (unambiguously, no less) to a stop clock approach even though it used the term \"tolling period\" to refer to existing state law grace periods in the second part of the sentence.  The statute\\'s text drops no hint of such a silent switch and it\\'s a lexicographical leap our traditional rules of statutory interpretation warn against.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That, though, represents just the beginning of the textual troubles with the approach the Court adopts.  Consider next the fact that section 1367(d) tells us to apply its federal tolling rule \"unless\" state law provides a \"longer tolling period.\"  In this way, the statute asks us to compare the length of the state \"tolling period\" with the length of the federal \"tolling period\" set by section 1367(d) and apply the longer one.  See ante, at 16 (courts apply the federal rule if \"the state-law tolling period will not be longer than §1367(d)\\'s\").  The equation we\\'re asked to perform is straightforward and sensible if we understand both the state and federal \"tolling periods\" discussed in this statute as grace periods.  We simply pick the longer grace period: is it the federal 30 day period or one provided by state law?\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0By contrast, the equation is anything but straightforward or sensible under the Court\\'s approach.  The Court tells us that, under its reading of the statute, the federal \"tolling period\" is the \"duration of the claim\\'s pendency in federal court\" plus 30 days.  See ante, at 12, 15.  So the decision whether to apply the federal or the state tolling period turns not on the sensible question which would afford the plaintiff more time to refile but instead on the happenstance of how long the plaintiff\\'s claim sat in federal court before dismissal.  Under the Court\\'s interpretation, we apply the federal stop clock rule if, but only if, the time the case happened to linger in federal court before dismissal (plus 30 days) is longer than the relevant state grace period.  But to state the test is to see it is a nonsense--one we would not lightly attribute to any rational drafter, let alone Congress.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Consider some examples of the absurdities that follow from the apples-to-oranges comparison the Court\\'s test requires.  Say state law provides a 5 year statute of limitations and a 1 year grace period for refiling.  The plaintiff files in federal court one day before the statute of limitations expires.  The litigation in federal court lasts 1 year.  Under the Court\\'s view, the federal \"tolling period\" would be 1 year plus 30 days--the time the claim was pending in federal court plus 30 days after dismissal.  That period is longer than the state tolling period of 1 year and so the federal tolling rule, not the state rule, controls--leaving the plaintiff only 31 days to refile her claim after dismissal even though state law would have allowed a full year.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0That may be curious enough, but curiouser it gets.  Now suppose the litigation in federal court lasts only 10 months.  That makes the federal tolling period only 11 months (10 months plus 30 days).  Under the Court\\'s view, state law now provides a longer tolling period (1 year) and the litigant gets a full year to refile in state court instead of 31 days.  No one has offered a reason why the happenstance of how long the federal litigation lasted should determine how much time a litigant has to refile in state court.  Yet that is what the Court\\'s reading of section 1367(d) demands.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Of course, it\\'s easy enough to imagine the rule the Court really wants to adopt today: it would like to afford litigants as a matter of federal law the benefit of a stop clock approach whenever doing so would yield more time to refile than the state\\'s grace period would permit.  But to accomplish so much we would need a very different statute than the one we have.  We would need to be able to compare the relevant state law grace \"tolling period\" not with the federal \"tolling period\" as the statute says but with the amount of time left under the relevant state limitations period on the date the plaintiff filed her federal suit.  The problem is, no one has even hinted how we might lawfully superimpose all those italicized words (entirely of our own devise) onto the statutory text.5\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0There are still more textual clues that we have lost our way today.  Congress spoke of the federal tolling period as embracing \"30 days after .\\xa0.\\xa0. dismissal.\"  That language sounds like and fits with a traditional grace period or journey\\'s account approach.  As we\\'ve seen, grace periods often speak about affording parties some short period of time after dismissal to refile their claims.  Meanwhile, this language proves no small challenge to square with a stop clock approach.  Generally we say a clock is stopped due to the onset of a particular event like a disability: something usually causes the stopping of the clock and when that something goes away, the clock restarts.  Here, the Court says, the clock stops once a claim is pending in federal court.  Yet it doesn\\'t restart when that something--the claim\\'s pendency--goes away but instead waits another 30 days before ticking again.  All without any apparent reason for the additional delay.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This case illustrates the oddity.  The petitioner filed her suit in federal court with 23 months remaining on the three year statute of limitations.  The case remained in federal district court for nearly three years before dismissal.  Under the grace period approach the 30 day provision does just as it appears, providing petitioner with 30 days to journey to and refile in the correct court.  Under the stop clock approach, though, the statute affords the petitioner 23 months plus a random 30 days more to refile.  Indeed, on the stop clock approach the only work the 30 day period is even imaginably left to do comes in cases where the plaintiff filed her federal suit at the very end of the limitations period.  And if that\\'s the only problem Congress sought to address, it chose a mighty murky way to do it, for the parties point to not a single stop clock provision in all of federal law that includes language anything like this.  All while (again) this language fits hand in glove with every grace period statute known.6\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Beyond all these textual clues lie important contextual ones too.  When Congress replants the roots of preexisting law in the federal code, this Court assumes it brings with it the surrounding soil, retaining the substance of the tradition it engages.  Respect for Congress, this Court has held, means assuming it knows and \"legislate[s] against a background of [the] common law .\\xa0.\\xa0. principles\" found in the field where it is working.  Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.\\xa0S. 305, 320, n. 13 (2010); see also Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U.\\xa0S. 174, 184-185 (1988).  And, as we\\'ve seen, the state law of tolling Congress expressly referenced and replanted in section 1367(d) comes heavily encrusted with meaning.  In cases involving dismissal and refiling, state statutory law and the common law from which it grew have long afforded a grace period to allow the litigant an appropriately tailored time to find his way to the proper court.  Meanwhile, a stop clock approach isn\\'t usually part of this ecosystem for nothing has disabled the litigant from reaching a court in the first place and all he must do is journey from the old court to the new one.  We don\\'t assume Congress strips replanted statutes of their soil, and we should not assume Congress displaced so much tradition in favor of something comparatively foreign.7\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Court\\'s reformation of the statute introduces another problem still--one of significantly greater magnitude yet.  In our constitutional structure, the federal government\\'s powers are supposed to be \"few and defined,\" while the powers reserved to the States \"remain .\\xa0.\\xa0. numerous and indefinite.\"  The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (Madison); McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819).  No doubt, the Constitution affords Congress the authority to make laws that are \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its defined duties.  Art.\\xa0I, §8, cl. 18.  But it is difficult to see how, on the Court\\'s interpretation, section 1367(d) might be said to survive that test--how it might be said to be necessary and proper to effectuate any recognized federal power or how it could be called anything other than an unconstitutional intrusion on the core state power to define the terms of state law claims litigated in state court proceedings.8\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under our precedent, the analysis here begins with Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U.\\xa0S. 456 (2003).  Without some tolling rule for dismissed state law supplemental claims, the Court in Jinks noted, federal courts would be left with \"three basic choices:\" (1) \"condition dismissal of the state-law claim on the defendant\\'s waiver of any statute-of-limitations defense in state court\"; (2) \"retain jurisdiction over the state-law claim even though it would more appropriately be heard in state court\"; or (3) \"dismiss the state-law claim but allow the plaintiff to reopen the fed-eral case if the state court later held the claim to be time barred.\"  Id., at 462-463.  All three choices, the Court held, would negatively affect the \"\\xa0\\'administration of justice\\' in federal court\" and thus impair the exercise of the enumerated \"judicial power\" of the federal government in Article III.  Id., at 462 (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the Court reasoned, some tolling rule \"assur[ing] that state-law claims asserted under [the supplemental jurisdiction statute] will not become time barred while pending in federal court\" is necessary and proper to the execution of the federal judicial power.  Id., at 464.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The necessary and proper federal interest Jinks recognized is fully discharged by a grace period.  Even petitioner appears to concede this.  See Brief for Petitioner 27 (\"Of course, the grace period approach also guarantees a plaintiff who is unsuccessful in federal court the opportunity to bring a claim in state court\").  Nor could anyone easily argue otherwise.  Jinks itself proceeded to uphold the constitutionality of section 1367(d) as necessary and proper on the basis of an understanding that the statute guaranteed just 30 days to a disappointed litigant to refile in state court.  No one in Jinks even hinted that a longer period might be necessary or proper to serve any valid federal interest.9\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0For good reason, it turns out.  Trying to imagine how the Court\\'s novel twist on section 1367(d) might serve a necessary and proper federal interest is a hard business.  To discharge the federal interest in preventing state law claims from \"becom[ing] time barred while pending in federal court\" it may be necessary to impose a short grace period.  But how is it necessary to do anything more than that, like consult the happenstance of how long the federal court took to dismiss the case and then tack an equivalent number of months or years onto state law limitations periods?  What federal interest could that even plausibly serve?  The Court does not and cannot attempt an answer because its proffered solution is simply orthogonal to any federal concern.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To be sure, the Court suggests that its approach will help the States.  See ante, at 19.  But a great many States have suggested the opposite, complaining to us that the Court\\'s approach will regularly relegate to the dustbin their own state limitations policy choices.  See Brief for State of Wisconsin et\\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 22-27; Brief for National Conference of State Legislatures et al. as Amici Curiae 6-29.  And surely they would seem better positioned than we to know their own interests.  To this, the Court replies that \"[w]ere the dissent\\'s position to prevail, cautious plaintiffs would surely\" file \"two actions [one in federal, the other in state court] and ask the state court to hold the suit filed there in abeyance pending disposition of the federal suit,\" causing \"plaintiffs to resort to wasteful, inefficient duplication.\"  Ante, at 19.  But, of course, this observation does nothing to tell us whether stop clock tolling is necessary to serve a federal interest.  Nor does it even tell us whether stop clock tolling is necessary to help the States.  A very long historical record before us suggests that grace periods have worked well to obviate the need for simultaneous filings in state and federal court; the Court offers no account why its innovation might be needed only now to rescue States from their own legislative choices about the appropriate lifespan of their state law claims.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Court\\'s approach isn\\'t just unnecessary; it isn\\'t proper either.  A law is not \"proper for carrying into [e]xecution\" an enumerated power if it \"violates the principle of state sovereignty\" reflected in our constitutional tradition.  Printz v. United States, 521 U.\\xa0S. 898, 923-924 (1997).  The word \"proper\" was \"used during the founding era to describe the powers of a governmental entity as peculiarly within the province or jurisdiction of that entity.\"  Lawson & Granger, The \"Proper\" Scope of Federal Power: A Jurisdictional Interpretation of the Sweeping Clause, 43 Duke L.\\xa0J. 267, 297 (1993).  Limitations periods for state law claims fall well within the peculiar province of state sovereign authority.  As Chancellor Kent explained, \"\\xa0\\'[t]he period sufficient to constitute a bar to the litigation of sta[l]e demands, is a question of municipal policy and regulation, and one which belongs to the discretion of every government, consulting its own interest and convenience.\\'\\xa0\"  Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U.\\xa0S. 717, 726 (1988) (quoting 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 462-463 (2d ed. 1832)).  Described as \"laws for administering justice,\" time bars are \"one of the most sacred and important of sovereign rights and duties.\"  Hawkins v. Barney\\'s Lessee, 5 Pet. 457, 466 (1831).  And \"from a remote antiquity,\" they have been the province of the sovereign \"by which it exercises its legislation for all persons and property within its jurisdiction.\"  McElmoyle ex rel. Bailey v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312, 327 (1839).  Our States have long \"exercise[d] this right in virtue of their sovereignty.\"  Ibid.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The decision today gives short shrift to these traditional interests.  Just consider how differently the two approaches treat States when it comes to one of their most \"important of sovereign rights.\"  Under a grace period approach, Congress simply fills a void, for the great bulk of States provide for grace periods of 30 days or longer; only a few States don\\'t allow that much or don\\'t speak to the question.  See n.\\xa03, supra.  So on the grace period account, Congress provides a modest backstop consistent with existing state law.  By contrast, under the stop clock interpretation, state law grace periods are displaced whenever the federal litigation (plus those odd 30 days) happens to be longer than the state law grace period.  And that, of course, is sure to happen often, for federal litigation is no quick business and state law grace periods often are.  Any time federal litigation (plus, again, 30 days) lasts longer than the 30 or 60 or 90 or 365 day grace period found in state law, state law will be forced to give way, and a federally mandated stop clock approach will usurp its place.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The stop clock approach, then, ensures that traditional state law judgments about the appropriate lifespan of state law claims will be routinely displaced--and displaced in favor of nothing more than a fortuity (the time a claim sits in federal court) that bears no rational relationship to any federal interest.  The Court\\'s approach forces state courts to entertain routinely state law claims that the state legislatures treat as no claims at all.  And it forces state courts to entertain claims that aren\\'t just stale by days or weeks under state law, but stale by months or even many years too.  So, for example, take a plaintiff who files suit in federal court shortly after a six year state law limitations period begins running and the litigation lasts six years before it\\'s finally dismissed.  Under the Court\\'s approach, federal law will now promise the plaintiff nearly six years more (plus those stray 30 days again) to refile his claim in state court.  Neither is this illustration fiction; it is drawn from the facts of Berke v. Buckley Broadcasting Corp., 821 A. 2d 118, 121 (N. J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2003).  See also Krause v. Textron Fin. Corp., 2007 WL 8054628, *1-2 (Fla. Cir. Ct. 2007); Brief for State of Wisconsin et al. as Amici Curiae 20-21 (offering many more examples).  Given all this, it\\'s no wonder that 24 States, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments complain that the result the Court reaches today flies in the face of federalism.10\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Court today clears away a fence that once marked a basic boundary between federal and state power.  Maybe it wasn\\'t the most vital fence and maybe we\\'ve just simply forgotten why this particular fence was built in the first place.  But maybe, too, we\\'ve forgotten because we\\'ve wandered so far from the idea of a federal government of limited and enumerated powers that we\\'ve begun to lose sight of what it looked like in the first place.  If the federal government can now, without any rational reason, force States to allow state law causes of action in state courts even though the state law limitations period expired many years ago, what exactly can\\'t it do to override the application of state law to state claims in state court?  What boundaries remain then?\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I respectfully dissent.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES\\nFootnote 1\\xa0The nonfederal claims Artis asserted arose under the D.\\xa0C. Code and common law; on dismissal of her federal-court suit, she refiled those claims in D.\\xa0C. Superior Court.  For the purpose at hand, District of Columbia law and courts are treated as state law and courts.  See 28 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §1367(e) (\"As used in this section, the term \\'State\\' includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United States.\").\\nFootnote 2\\xa0The D.\\xa0C. False Claims Act and the tort of wrongful termination each have a three-year statute of limitations that started to run on the day Artis lost her job in November 2010.  See D.\\xa0C.

American Dental Assn., 789 A.\\xa02d 1248, 1249, 1252 (D.\\xa0C. 2002) (tort of wrongful termination governed by D.\\xa0C.\\'s catchall three-year limitations period and claim accrues on the date when plaintiff has unequivocal notice of termination).  Artis\\' whistleblower claim had a one-year limitations period, which began to accrue when Artis \"first bec[a]m[e] aware\" that she had been terminated for reporting her supervisor\\'s misconduct.  D.\\xa0C. Code §1-615.54(a)(2).  The parties dispute the date the whistleblower claim accrued.  See Brief for Petitioner 10, n. 2; Brief for Respondent 8, n.\\xa02.\\nFootnote 3\\xa0The high courts of Maryland and Minnesota, along with the Sixth Circuit, have held that §1367(d)\\'s tolling rule pauses the clock on the statute of limitations until 30 days after the state-law claim is dismissed.  See In\\xa0re Vertrue Inc. Marketing & Sales Practices Litigation, 719 F.\\xa03d 474, 481 (CA6 2013); Goodman v. Best Buy, Inc., 777 N.\\xa0W. 2d 755, 759-760 (Minn. 2010); Turner v. Kight, 406 Md. 167, 180-182, 957 A.\\xa02d 984, 992-993 (2008).  In addition to the D.\\xa0C. Court of Appeals, the high courts of California and the Northern Mariana Islands have held that §1367(d) provides only a 30-day grace period for the refiling of otherwise time-barred claims.  See Los Angeles v. County of Kern, 59 Cal. 4th 618, 622, 328 P.\\xa03d 56, 58 (2014); Juan v. Commonwealth, 2001 MP 18, 6 N. Mar.

Plainly, however, the several statutes just set out do not fit that description: They do not involve \"disabilities.\"  Instead, like §1367(d), they involve claims earlier commenced in another forum.\\nFootnote 5\\xa0As we recognized in Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U.\\xa0S. 650 (1983), there may be different ways of \"calculating the amount of time available to file suit after tolling has ended.\"  Id., at 652, n.\\xa01 (emphasis added).  In addition to the \"common-law\" stop-the-clock effect, id., at 655, under which the plaintiff must file within the amount of time left in the limitations period, a statute might either provide for the limitations period to be \"renewed,\" so that \"the plaintiff has the benefit of a new period as long as the original,\" or \"establish a fixed period such as six months or one year during which the plaintiff may file suit, without regard to the length of the original limitations period or the amount of time left when tolling began.\"  Id., at 652, n.\\xa01.  Notably, under each of the \"tolling effect[s]\" enumerated in Chardon, ibid., the word \"tolled\" means that the progression of the limitations clock is stopped for the duration of \"tolling.\"\\nFootnote 6\\xa0The dissent\\'s notion that federal tolling periods may be understood as grace periods, not stop-the-clock periods, see post, at 7-8, is entirely imaginative.\\nFootnote 7\\xa0Also illustrative, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prescribes a five-year limitations period for certain suits.  15 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §1691e(f\\xa0).  Where a government agency has brought a timely suit, however, an individual may bring an action \"not later than one year after the commencement of that proceeding or action.\"  Ibid.\\nFootnote 8\\xa0Reasons of history, context, and policy, the dissent maintains, would have made it sensible for Congress to have written a grace-period statute.  See post, at 4-5.  But \"[t]he controlling principle in this case is the basic and unexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written[,] .\\xa0.\\xa0. giving each word its ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\"  Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.\\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nFootnote 9\\xa0This is indeed a definition sometimes used in reference to a right.  See, e.g., Ricard v. Williams, 7 Wheat. 59, 120 (1822) (\"[A]n adverse possession .\\xa0.\\xa0. toll[s] the right of entry of the heirs, and, consequently, extinguish[es], by the lapse of time, their right of action for the land.\").  See also Black\\'s Law Dictionary 1488 (6th ed. 1990) (\"toll\" can mean \"bar, defeat, or take away; thus, to toll the entry means to deny or take away the right of entry\").  The dissent, also relying on this sense of the word \"toll,\" cites Chardon as support for the proposition that §1367(d)\\'s tolling instruction is ambiguous.  See post, at 3; supra, at 8, n.\\xa05.  But, importantly, the grace-period statutes noted in Chardon, 462 U.\\xa0S., at 660, n.\\xa013, were precise about their operation.  Chardon provides no support for the notion that a statute\\'s instruction that a \"period of limitations shall be tolled\" plausibly could mean that the limitations clock continues to run but its effect as a bar is removed during the tolling.  See post, at 2-3.\\nFootnote 10\\xa0The District emphasizes that the Reporter\\'s note accompanying the ALI\\'s proposed statute stated: \"[A]ny governing statute of limitations is tolled by the commencement of an action in a federal court, and for at least thirty days following dismissal .\\xa0.\\xa0. in any case in which the dismissal was for lack of jurisdiction.\"  ALI Study 66.  The similarity between this language and §1367(d), the District argues, rebuts any argument that Congress did not adopt the ALI\\'s recommendation.  We are unpersuaded.  The District offers no explanation why, if Congress wanted to follow the substance of the ALI\\'s grace-period recommendation, it would neither cite the ALI Study in the legislative history of §1367(d), see infra this page, nor adopt the precise language of either the proposed statute or the Reporter\\'s note.  The ALI Study, moreover, cautions that the Reporter\\'s notes reflect \"the Reporter\\'s work alone,\" not a position taken by the Institute.  ALI Study, p. x.\\nFootnote 11\\xa0The dissent offers a history lesson on the ancient common-law principle of \"journey\\'s account,\" see post, at 5-6, and n.\\xa04, but nothing suggests that the 101st Congress had any such ancient law in mind when it drafted §1367(d).  Cf. post, at 9.  More likely, Congress was mindful that \"suspension\" during the pendency of other litigation is \"the common-law rule.\"  Chardon, 462 U.\\xa0S., at 655.\\nFootnote 12\\xa0The dissent, post, at 8-9, conjures up absurdities not presented by this case, for the District of Columbia has no law of the kind the dissent describes.  All agree that the phrase \"unless State law provides for a longer tolling period\" leaves room for a more generous state-law regime.  The dissent posits a comparison between the duration of the federal suit, plus 30 days, and a state-law grace period.  But of course, as the dissent recognizes, post, at 9, the more natural comparison is between the amount of time a plaintiff has left to refile, given the benefit of §1367(d)\\'s tolling rule, and the amount of time she would have to refile under the applicable state law.  Should the extraordinary circumstances the dissent envisions in fact exist in a given case, the comparison the dissent makes would be far from inevitable.\\nFootnote 13\\xa0The dissent refers to an \"understanding,\" post, at 14, by the Court in Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U.\\xa0S. 456 (2003), that §1367(d) accords only a 30-day \"window\" for refiling in state court.  Scattered characterizations in the Jinks briefing might be seen as conveying that understanding.  See post, at 14, n.\\xa09.  The opinion itself, however, contains nary a hint of any such understanding.  And indeed, one year earlier, we described §1367(d) as having the effect of stopping the clock, i.e., \"toll[ing] the state statute of limitations for 30 days in addition to however long the claim had been pending in federal court.\"  Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533, 542 (2002).\\nFOOTNOTES\\nFootnote 1\\xa0See Developments in the Law: Statutes of Limitations, 63 Harv. L.

But even here the Court does not attempt to explain how the latter comparison might be fairly extracted from the statutory text--let alone only in \"extraordinary circumstances.\"\\nFootnote 6\\xa0The Court offers a couple of competing textual arguments but neither can bear much weight.\\nFirst, the Court suggests that deriving a grace period from the statutory term \"period of limitations\" requires \"strain[ing].\"  Ante, at 12.  But the fact is both the grace period and stop clock interpretations require some (and some very similar) inferences.  The grace period approach construes the term \"period of limitations\" as directing us to the \"effect of the period of limitations\" that is tolled or taken away.  For its part meanwhile, the stop clock approach construes \"period of limitations\" to refer to the \"running of the period of limitations\" that is tolled or taken away.  The question is which inference is more persuasive.  And in light of the dual kinds of tolling the law has long recognized, as well as the textual and contextual clues before us (some still to be discussed), the better answer is clear.\\nSecond, the Court complains that the grace period interpretation renders \"superfluous\" the phrase \"while the claim is pending.\"  Ante, at 12.  But the phrase does important work under the grace period approach, ensuring that the expiration of limitations period does not take effect while the claim is pending in federal court.  Indeed and somewhat paradoxically, the Court itself implicitly recognizes that the language does real work when it suggests (in its next sentence no less) that the grace period approach could \"yield an absurdity\" by working to revive a claim that has already expired before it is brought in federal court.  Ante, at 12-13.  There is of course no absurdity in it, for the term \"while the claim is pending\" does the important work of addressing that very concern, preventing the expiration of the statute of limitations from taking effect while the claim is pending even as the language also and sensibly permits the statute of limitations to take effect if it expires before the plaintiff files his claim in federal court.\\nFootnote 7\\xa0The Court dismisses this \"history lesson\" on the ground that it doesn\\'t know if Congress had \"the ancient common-law .\\xa0.\\xa0. in mind.\"  Ante, at 14, n.\\xa011.  But respect for Congress\\'s competency means we presume it knows the substance of the state laws it expressly incorporates into its statutes and the common law against which it operates.  See supra, at 11.  When the Court turns to offer its own competing contextual evidence, it observes that a stop clock approach can be found in many other places in the U.\\xa0S. Code.  See ante, at 7, and n. 4, 15-16.  But it turns out the Court\\'s stop clock examples often involve situations where some disability prevents the plaintiff from proceeding to court.  See, e.g., 26 U.\\xa0S.\\xa0C. §6213(f\\xa0)(1) (limitations period for filing a petition in the Tax Court \"shall be suspended for the period during which the debtor is prohibited .\\xa0.\\xa0. from filing a petition\"); §6503(a)(1) (limitations period on making an assessment shall \"be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the assessment\").  Notably, not one of the Court\\'s examples purports to address a situation like the one we face: where the plaintiff has proven able to come to court but merely chosen the wrong one.  The Court\\'s own contextual evidence, then, serves to illustrate just how unusual and out of place a stop clock approach would be here.\\nFootnote 8\\xa0Of course, the case before us arises from litigation in the District of Columbia where the federal government enjoys plenary power.  See Art.\\xa0I, §8, cl. 17.  But the federalism concern here cannot be ignored, as the Court today rightly acknowledges (ante, at 16-19), because the statute at issue applies nationwide and the vast bulk of its applications come in the States and implicate state causes of action, state limitations laws, and state court proceedings.\\nFootnote 9\\xa0See Brief for Petitioner in Jinks v. Richland County, O.T. 2002, No. 02-258, p. 9 (\"The tolling window created lasts only 30 days after dismissal without prejudice from district court[.]\"); id., at 37 (section 1367(d) \"provides a de minimis window in which a plaintiff may refile in state court if the limitations period expires during the pendency of the federal district court action\"); Brief for Respondent in No. 02-258, p. 31 (describing section 1367(d) as providing \"a thirty-day tolling window\"); Brief for United States in No. 02-258, pp. 16, 22 (describing section 1367(d) as \"minimally intrusive on state prerogatives\" since it ensures that the \"statute of limitations on the pendent claim will not expire during the pendency of the federal-court action\"); Pet. for Cert. in No. 02-258, p. 22 (\"Section 1367(d) merely saves--for a maximum excess period of 30 days--a preexisting lawsuit that must be refiled to allow the matter to be heard in a forum preferable to the State, namely, in its own courts\"); see also Brief for State of Wisconsin et\\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 8-9.\\nFootnote 10\\xa0The Court\\'s reply--that stop clock tolling is \"standard\" and \"off-the-shelf\\xa0\"--is no answer.  Ante, at 19.  The propriety of a legal tool in one area does not establish its propriety in all; while stop clock tolling may be standard and off-the-shelf in other contexts (such as for equitable tolling) that doesn\\'t mean it is necessary and proper here.  Indeed, and as we\\'ve seen, the \"standard\" and \"off-the-shelf\" solution to the problem of dismissal and the need to refile is the one adopted at common law and by state law: a grace period.

      "Federal district courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state claims not otherwise within their adjudicatory authority if those claims are \"part of the same case or controversy\" as the federal claims the plaintiff asserts.  28 U. S. C. §1367(a).  When a district court dismisses all claims independently qualifying for the exercise of federal jurisdiction, it ordinarily also dismisses all related state claims.  See §1367(c)(3).  Section 1367(d) provides that the \"period of limitations for\" refiling in state court a state claim so dismissed \"shall be tolled while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"  \n",
      "          When petitioner Artis filed a federal-court suit against respondent District of Columbia (District), alleging a federal employment-discrimination claim and three allied claims under D. C. law, nearly two years remained on the applicable statute of limitations for the D. C.-law violations.  Two and a half years later, the Federal District Court ruled against Artis on her sole federal claim and dismissed the D. C.-law claims under §1367(c).  Fifty-nine days after the dismissal, Artis refiled her state-law claims in the D. C. Superior Court, but that court dismissed them as time barred.  The D. C. Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that §1367(d) accorded Artis only a 30-day grace period to refile in state court and rejecting her argument that the word \"tolled\" in §1367(d) means that the limitations period is suspended during the pendency of the federal suit.  \n",
      "Held: \n",
      "     1. Section 1367(d)'s instruction to \"toll\" a state limitations period means to hold it in abeyance, i.e., to stop the clock.  Pp. 7-16.\n",
      "          (a) Statutes that shelter from time bars claims earlier commenced in another forum generally employ one of two means.  First, the period of limitations may be \"tolled,\" i.e., suspended, while the claim is pending elsewhere; the time clock starts running again when the tolling period ends, picking up where it left off.  A legislature may instead elect simply to provide a grace period, permitting the statute of limitations to run while the claim is pending in another forum and averting the risk of a time bar by according the plaintiff a fixed period in which to refile.  The District has identified no federal statute in which a grace-period meaning has been ascribed to the word \"tolled\" or any word similarly rooted.  And the one case in which this Court used tolling language to describe a grace period, see Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536, is a feather on the scale against the weight of decisions in which \"tolling\" a statute of limitations signals stopping the clock.  Pp. 7-11.\n",
      "          (b) Considering first the ordinary meaning of the statutory language, §1367(d) is phrased as a tolling provision.  It suspends the statute of limitations both while the claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days postdismissal.  Artis' interpretation is a natural fit with this language.  The District, in contrast, reads \"tolled\" to mean to remove, temporarily, the bar that would ordinarily accompany the expiration of the limitations period.  But the District offers no reason to home in only on the word \"tolled\" itself and ignore information about the verb's ordinary meaning gained from its grammatical object, \"period of limitations.\"  That object sheds light on what it means to \"be tolled.\"  The District's reading also tenders a strained interpretation of the phrase \"period of limitations\"; makes the first portion of the tolling period, the duration of the claim's pendency in federal court, superfluous; and could yield an absurdity, permitting a plaintiff to refile in state court even if the limitations period on her claim had expired before she filed in federal court.  Pp. 11-13.\n",
      "          (c) The D. C. Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Congress adopted an American Law Institute (ALI) recommendation to allow refiling in state court only for 30 days after a dismissal.  The ALI provision, like §1367(d), established a 30-day federal floor on the time allowed for refiling, but it did not provide for tolling \"while the [state] claim is pending\" in federal court.  Pp. 13-14.\n",
      "          (d) The 30-day provision casts no large shadow on Artis' stop-the-clock interpretation.  The provision accounts for cases in which a plaintiff commenced a federal action close to the expiration date of the relevant state statute of limitations, by giving such a plaintiff breathing space to refile in state court.  Adding a brief span of days to the tolling period is not unusual in stop-the-clock statutes.  See, e.g., 46 U. S. C. §53911.  Section 1367(d)'s proviso \"unless State law provides for a longer tolling period\" could similarly aid a plaintiff who filed in federal court just short of the expiration of the state limitations period.  Pp. 14-16.\n",
      "     2. The stop-the-clock interpretation of §1367(d) does not present a serious constitutional problem.  In Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, the Court rejected an argument that §1367(d) impermissibly exceeds Congress' authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Id., at 464-465.  The District contends that a stop-the-clock prescription serves \"no federal purpose\" that could not be served by a grace-period prescription.  But both devices are standard, off-the-shelf means of accounting for the fact that a claim was timely pressed in another forum.  Requiring Congress to choose one over the other would impose a tighter constraint on Congress' discretion than this Court has countenanced.  A concern that a stop-the-clock prescription entails a greater imposition on the States than a grace-period prescription may also be more theoretical than real.  Finally, a stop-the-clock rule like §1367(d) is suited to the primary purposes of limitations statutes: \" 'preventing surprises' \" to defendants and \" 'barring a plaintiff who has slept on his rights.' \"  American Pipe & Constr.

      "     Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n",
      "     The Supplemental Jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. §1367, enables federal district courts to entertain claims not otherwise within their adjudicatory authority when those claims \"are so related to claims . . . within [federal-court competence] that they form part of the same case or controversy.\"  §1367(a).  Included within this supplemental jurisdiction are state claims brought along with federal claims arising from the same episode.  When district courts dismiss all claims independently qualifying for the exercise of federal jurisdiction, they ordinarily dismiss as well all related state claims.  See §1367(c)(3).  A district court may also dismiss the related state claims if there is a good reason to decline jurisdiction.  See §1367(c)(1), (2), and (4).  This case concerns the time within which state claims so dismissed may be refiled in state court.\n",
      "     Section 1367(d), addressing that issue, provides:\n",
      "\"The period of limitations for any [state] claim [ joined with a claim within federal-court competence] shall be tolled while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"\n",
      "The question presented: Does the word \"tolled,\" as used in §1367(d), mean the state limitations period is suspended during the pendency of the federal suit; or does \"tolled\" mean that, although the state limitations period continues to run, a plaintiff is accorded a grace period of 30 days to refile in state court post dismissal of the federal case?  Petitioner urges the first, or stop-the-clock, reading.  Respondent urges, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals adopted, the second, or grace-period, reading.\n",
      "     In the case before us, plaintiff-petitioner Stephanie C. Artis refiled her state-law claims in state court 59 days after dismissal of her federal suit.1  Reading §1367(d) as a grace-period prescription, her complaint would be time barred.  Reading §1367(d) as stopping the limitations clock during the pendency of the federal-court suit, her complaint would be timely.  We hold that §1367(d)'s instruction to \"toll\" a state limitations period means to hold it in abeyance, i.e., to stop the clock.  Because the D. C. Court of Appeals held that §1367(d) did not stop the D. C. Code's limitations clock, but merely provided a 30-day grace period for refiling in D. C. Superior Court, we reverse the D. C. Court of Appeals' judgment.\n",

      "     Section 1367, which Congress added to Title 28 as part of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 5089, codifies the court-developed pendent and ancillary jurisdiction doctrines under the label \"supplemental jurisdiction.\"  See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 552-558 (2005) (describing the development of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction doctrines and subsequent enactment of §1367); id., at 579-584 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (same).  The House Report accompanying the Act explains that Congress sought to clarify the scope of federal courts' authority to hear claims within their supplemental jurisdiction, appreciating that \"[s]upplemental jurisdiction has enabled federal courts and litigants to . . . deal economically--in single rather than multiple litigation--with related matters.\"  H. R. Rep. No. 101-734, p. 28 (1990) (H. R. Rep.).  Section 1367(a) provides, in relevant part, that a district court with original jurisdiction over a claim \"shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims . . . form[ing] part of the same case or controversy.\"\n",
      "      \"[N]ot every claim within the same 'case or controversy' as the claim within the federal courts' original jurisdiction will be decided by the federal court.\"  Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 459 (2003).  Section 1367(c) states:\n",
      "     \"The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if--\n",
      "     \"(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,\n",
      "     \"(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,\n",
      "     \"(3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or\n",
      "     \"(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.\"\n",
      "     If a district court declines to exercise jurisdiction over a claim asserted under §1367(a) and the plaintiff wishes to continue pursuing it, she must refile the claim in state court.  If the state court would hold the claim time barred, however, then, absent a curative provision, the district court's dismissal of the state-law claim without prejudice would be tantamount to a dismissal with prejudice.  See, e.g., Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U. S. 343, 352 (1988) (under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, if the statute of limitations on state-law claims expires before the federal court \"relinquish[es] jurisdiction[,] . . . a dismissal will foreclose the plaintiff from litigating his claims\").  To prevent that result, §1367(d) supplies \"a tolling rule that must be applied by state courts.\"  Jinks, 538 U. S., at 459.  Section 1367(d) provides:\n",
      "\"The period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a), and for any other claim in the same action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or after the dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"\n",
      "This case requires us to determine how §1367(d)'s tolling rule operates.\n",
      "B\n",
      "     Petitioner Artis worked as a health inspector for respondent, the District of Columbia (the \"District\").  In November 2010, Artis was told she would lose her job.  Thirteen months later, Artis sued the District in the  United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that she had suffered employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq.  She also asserted three allied claims under D. C. law: retaliation in violation of the District of Columbia Whistleblower Act, D. C. Code §1-615.54 (2001); termination in violation of the District of Columbia False Claims Act, §2-381.04; and wrongful termination against public policy, a common-law claim.  Artis alleged that she had been subjected to gender discrimination by her supervisor, and thereafter encountered retaliation for reporting the supervisor's unlawful activities.  See Artis v. District of Columbia, 51 F. Supp. 3d 135, 137 (2014).\n",
      "     On June 27, 2014, the District Court granted the District's motion for summary judgment on the Title VII claim.  Having dismissed Artis' sole federal claim, the District Court, pursuant to §1367(c)(3), declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her remaining state-law claims.  \"Artis will not be prejudiced,\" the court noted, \"because 28 U. S. C. §1367(d) provides for a tolling of the statute of limitations during the period the case was here and for at least 30 days thereafter.\"  Id., at 142.\n",
      "     Fifty-nine days after the dismissal of her federal action, Artis refiled her state-law claims in the D. C. Superior Court, the appropriate local court.  The Superior Court granted the District's motion to dismiss, holding that Artis' claims were time barred, because they were filed 29 days too late.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a.  When Artis first asserted her state-law claims in the District Court, nearly two years remained on the applicable three-year statute of limitations.2  But two and a half years passed before the federal court relinquished jurisdiction.  Unless §1367(d) paused the limitations clock during that time, Artis would have had only 30 days to refile.  The Superior Court rejected Artis' stop-the-clock reading of §1367(d), reasoning that Artis could have protected her state-law claims by \"pursuing [them] in a state court while the federal court proceeding [was] pending.\"  Ibid.  In tension with that explanation, the court noted that duplicative filings in federal and state court are \"generally disfavored . . . as 'wasteful' and . . . 'against [the interests of] judicial efficiency.' \"  Id., at 14a, n. 1 (quoting Stevens v. Arco Management of Wash. D.C., Inc., 751 A. 2d 995, 1002 (D. C. 2000); alteration in original).\n",
      "     The D. C. Court of Appeals affirmed.  That court began by observing that two \"competing approaches [to §1367(d)] have evolved nationally\": the stop-the-clock reading and the grace-period reading.  135 A. 3d 334, 337 (2016).3  Without further comment on §1367(d)'s text, the D. C. Court of Appeals turned to the legislative history.  Section 1367(d)'s purpose, the court noted, was \"to prevent the loss of claims to statutes of limitations where state law might fail to toll the running of the period of limitations while a supplemental claim was pending in federal court.\"  Id., at 338 (quoting H. R. Rep., at 30; internal quotation marks omitted).  Following the lead of the California Supreme Court, the D. C. Court of Appeals determined that Congress had intended to implement a 1969 recommendation by the American Law Institute (ALI) to allow refiling in state court \"within 30 days after dismissal.\"  135 A. 3d, at 338 (quoting Los Angeles v. County of Kern, 59 Cal. 4th 618, 629, 328 P. 3d 56, 63 (2014)).\n",
      "     The D. C. Court of Appeals also concluded that the grace-period approach \"better accommodates federalism concerns,\" by trenching significantly less on state statutes of limitations than the stop-the-clock approach.  135 A. 3d, at 338-339.  Construing §1367(d) as affording only a 30-day grace period, the court commented, was \"consistent with [its] presumption favoring narrow interpretations of federal preemption of state law.\"  Id., at 339.\n",
      "     To resolve the division of opinion among State Supreme Courts on the proper construction of §1367(d), see supra, at 6, n. 3, we granted certiorari.  580 U. S. ___ (2017).\n",
      "II\n",
      "A\n",
      "     As just indicated, statutes that shelter from time bars claims earlier commenced in another forum generally employ one of two means.\n",
      "     First, the period (or statute) of limitations may be \"tolled\" while the claim is pending elsewhere.4  Ordinarily, \"tolled,\" in the context of a time prescription like §1367(d), means that the limitations period is suspended (stops running) while the claim is sub judice elsewhere, then starts running again when the tolling period ends, picking up where it left off.  See Black's Law Dictionary 1488 (6th ed. 1990) (\"toll,\" when paired with the grammatical object \"statute of limitations,\" means \"to suspend or stop temporarily\").  This dictionary definition captures the rule generally applied in federal courts.  See, e.g., Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U. S. 650, 652, n. 1 (1983) (Court's opinion \"use[d] the word 'tolling' to mean that, during the relevant period, the statute of limitations ceases to run\").5  Our decisions employ the terms \"toll\" and \"suspend\" interchangeably.  For example, in American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974), we characterized as a \"tolling\" prescription a rule \"suspend[ing] the applicable statute of limitations,\" id., at 554; accordingly, we applied the rule to stop the limitations clock, id., at 560-561.6  We have similarly comprehended what tolling means in decisions on equitable tolling.  See, e.g., CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7) (describing equitable tolling as \"a doctrine that pauses the running of, or 'tolls' a statute of limitations\" (some internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Ibarra, 502 U. S. 1, 4, n. 2 (1991) ( per curiam) (\"Principles of equitable tolling usually dictate that when a time bar has been suspended and then begins to run again upon a later event, the time remaining on the clock is calculated by subtracting from the full limitations period whatever time ran before the clock was stopped.\").\n",
      "     In lieu of \"tolling\" or \"suspending\" a limitations period by pausing its progression, a legislature might elect simply to provide a grace period.  When that mode is adopted, the statute of limitations continues to run while the claim is pending in another forum.  But the risk of a time bar is averted by according the plaintiff a fixed period in which to refile.  A federal statute of that genre is 28 U. S. C. §2415.  That provision prescribes a six-year limitations period for suits seeking money damages from the United States for breach of contract.  §2415(a).  The statute further provides: \"In the event that any action . . . is timely brought and is thereafter dismissed without prejudice, the action may be recommenced within one year after such dismissal, regardless of whether the action would otherwise then be barred by this section.\"  §2415(e).7  Many States have enacted similar grace-period provisions.  See App. to Brief for National Conference of State Legislatures et al. as Amici Curiae 1a-25a.  For example, Georgia law provides:\n",
      "\"When any case has been commenced in either a state or federal court within the applicable statute of limitations and the plaintiff discontinues or dismisses the same, it may be recommenced in a court of this state or in a federal court either within the original applicable period of limitations or within six months after the discontinuance or dismissal, whichever is later . . . .\"  Ga. Code Ann. §9-2-61(a) (2007).\n",
      "     Tellingly, the District has not identified any federal statute in which a grace-period meaning has been ascribed to the word \"tolled\" or any word similarly rooted.  Nor has the dissent, for all its mighty strivings, identified even one federal statute that fits its bill, i.e., a federal statute that says \"tolled\" but means something other than \"suspended,\" or \"paused,\" or \"stopped.\"  From what statutory text, then, does the dissent start?  See post, at 5.8 \n",
      "     Turning from statutory texts to judicial decisions, only once did an opinion of this Court employ tolling language to describe a grace period: Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536 (1989).  In Hardin, we held that, in 42 U. S. C. §1983 suits, federal courts should give effect to state statutes sheltering claims from time bars during periods of a plaintiff's legal disability.  We there characterized a state statute providing a one-year grace period as \"tolling\" or \"suspend[ing]\" the limitations period \"until one year after the disability has been removed.\"  490 U. S., at 537.  This atypical use of \"tolling\" or \"suspending\" to mean something other than stopping the clock on a limitations period is a feather on the scale against the weight of decisions in which \"tolling\" a statute of limitations signals stopping the clock.\n",
      "B\n",
      "     In determining the meaning of a statutory provision, \"we look first to its language, giving the words used their ordinary meaning.\"  Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Section 1367(d) is phrased as a tolling provision.  It suspends the statute of limitations for two adjacent time periods: while the claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days postdismissal.  Artis urges that the phrase \"shall be tolled\" in §1367(d) has the same meaning it does in the statutes cited supra, at 7, n. 4.  That is, the limitations clock stops the day the claim is filed in federal court and, 30 days postdismissal, restarts from the point at which it had stopped.\n",
      "     The District reads \"tolled\" for §1367(d)'s purposes differently.  To \"toll,\" the District urges, means to \"remove or take away an effect.\"  Brief for Respondent 12-13.  To \"toll\" a limitations period, then, would mean to \"remov[e] the bar that ordinarily would accompany its expiration.\"  Id., at 14.9  \"[T]here is nothing special,\" the District maintains, \"about tolling limitations periods versus tolling any other fact, right, or consequence.\"  Id., at 13.  But the District offers no reason why, in interpreting \"tolled\" as used in §1367(d), we should home in only on the word itself, ignoring the information about the verb's ordinary meaning gained from its grammatical object.  Just as when the object of \"tolled\" is \"bell\" or \"highway traveler,\" the object \"period of limitations\" sheds light on what it means to \"be tolled.\"\n",
      "     The District's reading, largely embraced by the dissent, is problematic for other reasons as well.  First, it tenders a strained interpretation of the phrase \"period of limitations.\"  In the District's view, \"period of limitations\" means \"the effect of the period of limitations as a time bar.\"  See id., at 18 (\"Section 1367(d) . . . provides that 'the period of limitations'--here its effect as a time bar--'shall be [removed or taken away] while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed.' \" (alterations in original)).  Second, the first portion of the tolling period, the duration of the claim's pendency in federal court, becomes superfluous under the District's construction.  The \"effect\" of the limitations period as a time bar, on the District's reading, becomes operative only after the case has been dismissed.  That being so, what need would there be to remove anything while the claim is pending in federal court?\n",
      "     Furthermore, the District's reading could yield an absurdity: It could permit a plaintiff to refile in state court even if the limitations period on her claim had expired before she filed in federal court.  To avoid that result, the District's proposed construction of \"tolled\" as \"removed\" could not mean simply \"removed.\"  Instead, \"removed\" would require qualification to express \"removed, unless the period of limitations expired before the claim was filed in federal court.\"  In sum, the District's interpretation maps poorly onto the language of §1367(d), while Artis' interpretation is a natural fit.\n",
      "C\n",
      "     The D. C. Court of Appeals adopted the District's grace-period construction primarily because it was convinced that in drafting §1367(d), Congress embraced an ALI recommendation.  135 A. 3d, at 338.  Two decades before the enactment of §1367(d), the ALI, in its 1969 Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, did recommend a 30-day grace period for refiling certain claims.  The ALI proposed the following statutory language:\n",
      "\"If any claim in an action timely commenced in a federal court is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim, a new action on the same claim brought in another court shall not be barred by a statute of limitations that would not have barred the original action had it been commenced in that court, if such new action is brought in a proper court, federal or State, within thirty days after dismissal of the original claim has become final or within such longer period as may be available under applicable State law.\"  ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts §1386(b), p. 65 (1969) (ALI Study).\n",
      "Congress, however, did not adopt the ALI's grace-period formulation.  Instead, it ordered tolling of the state limitations period \"while the claim is pending\" in federal court.  Although the provision the ALI proposed, like §1367(d), established a 30-day federal floor on the time allowed for refiling, it did not provide for tolling the period of limitations while a claim is pending.10  True, the House Report contained a citation to the ALI Study, but only in reference to a different provision, 28 U. S. C. §1391 (the general venue statute).  There, Congress noted that its approach was \"taken from the ALI Study.\"  H. R. Rep., at 23.  Had Congress similarly embraced the ALI's grace-period formulation in §1367(d), one might expect the House Report to have said as much.11\n",
      "D\n",
      "     The District asks us to zero in on §1367(d)'s \"express inclusion\" of the \"period of 30 days after the claim is dismissed\" within the tolling period.  Brief for Respondent 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under Artis' stop-the-clock interpretation, the District contends, \"the inclusion of 30 days within the tolling period would be relegated to insignificance in the mine-run of cases.\"  Id., at 21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  In §1367(d), Congress did provide for tolling not only while the claim is pending in federal court, but also for 30 days thereafter.  Including the 30 days within §1367(d)'s tolling period accounts for cases in which a federal action is commenced close to the expiration date of the relevant state statute of limitations.  In such a case, the added days give the plaintiff breathing space to refile in state court.\n",
      "     Adding a brief span of days to the tolling period is not unusual in stop-the-clock statutes.  In this respect, §1367(d) closely resembles 46 U. S. C. §53911, which provides, in a subsection titled \"Tolling of limitations period,\" that if a plaintiff submits a claim for war-related vessel damage to the Secretary of Transportation, \"the running of the limitations period for bringing a civil action is suspended until the Secretary denies the claim, and for 60 days thereafter.\"  §53911(d).  Numerous other statutes similarly append a fixed number of days to an initial tolling period.  See, e.g., 22 U. S. C. §1631k(c) (\"Statutes of limitations on assessments . . . shall be suspended with respect to any vested property . . . while vested and for six months thereafter. . . .\"); 26 U. S. C. §6213(f )(1) (\"In any case under title 11 of the United States Code, the running of the time prescribed by subsection (a) for filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to any deficiency shall be suspended for the period during which the debtor is prohibited by reason of such case from filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to such deficiency, and for 60 days thereafter.\"); §6503(a)(1) (\"The running of the period of limitations provided in section 6501 or 6502 . . . shall . . . be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the assessment . . . and for 60 days thereafter.\"); 50 U. S. C. §4000(c) (\"The running of a statute of limitations against the collection of tax deferred under this section . . . shall be suspended for the period of military service of the servicemember and for an additional period of 270 days thereafter.\").  Thus, the \"30 days\" provision casts no large shadow on Artis' interpretation.\n",
      "     Section 1367(d)'s proviso, \"unless State law provides for a longer tolling period,\" could similarly aid a plaintiff who filed in federal court just short of the expiration of the state limitations period.  She would have the benefit of §1367(d)'s 30-days-to-refile prescription, or such longer time as state law prescribes.12  It may be that, in most cases, the state-law tolling period will not be longer than §1367(d)'s.  But in some cases it undoubtedly will.  For example, Indiana permits a plaintiff to refile within three years of dismissal.  See Ind. Code §34-11-8-1 (2017).  And Louisiana provides that after dismissal the limitations period \"runs anew.\"  La. Civ. Code Ann., Arts. 3462, 3466 (West 2007).\n",
      "III\n",
      "     Satisfied that Artis' text-based arguments overwhelm the District's, we turn to the District's contention that the stop-the-clock interpretation of §1367(d) raises a significant constitutional question: Does the statute exceed Congress' authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, because its connection to Congress' enumerated powers is too attenuated or because it is too great an incursion on the States' domain?  Brief for Respondent 46-49.  To avoid constitutional doubt, the District urges, we should adopt its reading.  \"[W]here an alternative interpretation of [a] statute is fairly possible,\" the District reminds, we have construed legislation in a manner that \"avoid[s] [serious constitutional] problems\" raised by \"an otherwise acceptable construction.\"  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 299-300 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But even if we regarded the District's reading of §1367(d) as \"fairly possible,\" our precedent would undermine the proposition that §1367(d) presents a serious constitutional problem.  See Jinks, 538 U. S., at 461-465.\n",
      "     In Jinks, we unanimously rejected an argument that §1367(d) impermissibly exceeds Congress' enumerated powers.13  Section 1367(d), we held, \"is necessary and proper for carrying into execution Congress's power '[t]o constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court,' . . . and to assure that those tribunals may fairly and efficiently exercise '[t]he judicial Power of the United States.' \"  Id., at 462 (quoting U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 9, and Art. III, §1).\n",
      "     In two principal ways, we explained, §1367(d) is \"conducive to the due administration of justice in federal court.\"  538 U. S., at 462 (internal quotation marks omitted).  First, \"it provides an alternative to the unsatisfactory options that federal judges faced when they decided whether to retain jurisdiction over supplemental state-law claims that might be time barred in state court.\"  Ibid.  Section 1367(d) thus \"unquestionably promotes fair and efficient operation of the federal courts.\"  Id., at 463.  Second, §1367(d) \"eliminates a serious impediment to access to the federal courts on the part of plaintiffs pursuing federal- and state-law claims\" arising from the same episode.  Ibid.  With tolling available, a plaintiff disinclined to litigate simultaneously in two forums is no longer impelled to choose between forgoing either her federal claims or her state claims.\n",
      "     Moreover, we were persuaded that §1367(d) was \"plainly adapted\" to Congress' exercise of its enumerated power: there was no cause to suspect that Congress had enacted §1367(d) as a \" 'pretext' for 'the accomplishment of objects not entrusted to [it],' \"; nor was there reason to believe that the connection between §1367(d) and Congress' authority over the federal courts was too attenuated.  Id., at 464 (quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 423 (1819)).\n",
      "     Our decision in Jinks also rejected the argument that §1367(d) was not \"proper\" because it violates principles of state sovereignty by prescribing a procedural rule for state courts' adjudication of purely state-law claims.  538 U. S., at 464-465.  \"Assuming [without deciding] that a principled dichotomy can be drawn, for purposes of determining whether an Act of Congress is 'proper,' between federal laws that regulate state-court 'procedure' and laws that change the 'substance' of state-law rights of action,\" we concluded that the tolling of state limitations periods \"falls on the [permissible] 'substantive' side of the line.\"  Ibid.\n",
      "     The District's contention that a stop-the-clock prescription serves \"no federal purpose\" that could not be served by a grace-period prescription is unavailing.  Brief for Respondent 49.  Both devices are standard, off-the-shelf means of accounting for the fact that a claim was timely pressed in another forum.  Requiring Congress to choose one over the other would impose a tighter constraint on Congress' discretion than we have ever countenanced.\n",
      "     The concern that a stop-the-clock prescription entails a greater imposition on the States than a grace-period prescription, moreover, may be more theoretical than real.  Consider the alternative suggested by the D. C. Superior Court.  Plaintiffs situated as Artis was could simply file two actions and ask the state court to hold the suit filed there in abeyance pending disposition of the federal suit.  See supra, at 6.  Were the dissent's position to prevail, cautious plaintiffs would surely take up the D. C. Superior Court's suggestion.  How it genuinely advances federalism concerns to drive plaintiffs to resort to wasteful, inefficient duplication to preserve their state-law claims is far from apparent.  See, e.g., Stevens, 751 A. 2d, at 1002 (it \"work[s] against judicial efficiency . . . to compel prudent federal litigants who present state claims to file duplicative and wasteful protective suits in state court\").\n",
      "     We do not gainsay that statutes of limitations are \"fundamental to a well-ordered judicial system.\"  Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U. S. 478, 487 (1980).  We note in this regard, however, that a stop-the-clock rule is suited to the primary purposes of limitations statutes: \"preventing surprises\" to defendants and \"barring a plaintiff who has slept on his rights.\"  American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 554 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Whenever §1367(d) applies, the defendant will have notice of the plaintiff's claims within the state-prescribed limitations period.  Likewise, the plaintiff will not have slept on her rights.  She will have timely asserted those rights, endeavoring to pursue them in one litigation.\n",
      "*  *  *\n",
      "     For the reasons stated, we resist unsettling the usual understanding of the word \"tolled\" as it appears in legislative time prescriptions and court decisions thereon.  The judgment of the D. C. Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n",

      "     The same might be said about the law before us.  Section 1367(d) provides that \"[t]he period of limitations . . . shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"  28 U. S. C. §1367(d).  Grown from a rich common law and state statutory tradition, this provision serves a modest role.  If a federal court dismisses a party's state law claim without ruling on its merits, the law ensures the party will enjoy whatever time state law allows, or at least 30 days, to refile the claim in state court.\n",
      "     Today the Court clears away this traditional rule because it overlooks the original reasons for it.  For the first time in the statute's history the Court now reads the law to guarantee parties not 30 days or whatever state law permits but months or years more to refile their dismissed state law claims in state court.  Rather than reading the statute as generally deferring to state law judgments about the appropriate lifespan of state law claims brought in state courts, the Court now reads the statute as generally displacing them in favor of a new federal rule.  Indeed, the Court today tells state courts that they must routinely disregard clearly expressed state law defining the appropriate length of time parties should have to sue on state law claims in state tribunals.  Under the Court's rule, too, the disregard of state limitations law promises to be not only routine but substantial.  The Court's approach will require state courts to entertain state law claims that state law deems untimely not only by weeks or months but by many years, as 24 States, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments warn us.  And the Court demands all this without offering any rational account why it is necessary or proper to the exercise of one of the federal government's limited and enumerated powers.  It may only be a small statute we are interpreting, but the result the Court reaches today represents no small intrusion on traditional state functions and no small departure from our foundational principles of federalism.  Respectfully, I dissent.\n",
      "     Start with the statute's key term.  Where, as here, a law instructs us to \"toll\" a limitations period, we know it may be telling us to do one of (at least) two different things.  The dictionary informs that to \"toll\" means \"[t]o take away, bar, defeat, [or] annul.\"  See 18 Oxford English Dictionary 204 (2d ed. 1989); Webster's New International Dictionary 2662 (2d ed. 1957) (\"[t]o take away; to vacate; to annul\"); Oxford Latin Dictionary 1947 (1982) (\"tollere,\" the Latin origin, means to \"remove\" or \"lift\").  So when a statute speaks of tolling a limitations period it can, naturally enough, mean either that the running of the limitations period is suspended or that the effect of the limitations period is defeated.  The first understanding stops the limitations clock running until a specified event begins it running again: call it the stop clock approach.  The second understanding allows the limitations clock to continue to run but defeats the effect of the clock's expiration for an additional specified period of time: call it the grace period approach.\n",
      "     That both of these understandings of the word \"toll\" are indeed possible and in fact historically common this Court has already explained in Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U. S. 650 (1983):\n",
      "\" 'Tolling effect' refers to the method of calculating the amount of time available to file suit after tolling has ended.  The statute of limitations might merely be suspended; if so, the plaintiff must file within the amount of time left in the limitations period. . . .  It is also possible to establish a fixed period such as six months or one year during which the plaintiff may file suit, without regard to the length of the original limitations period or the amount of time left when tolling began.\"  Id., at 652, n. 1 (emphasis added).\n",
      "When it comes to federal law today, Chardon has further explained, both kinds of tolling can be found.  \"[S]ome federal statutes provide for suspension\" of the running of the limitations period, or the stop clock approach, while \"other statutes establish a variety of different tolling effects,\" including grace periods for refiling after dismissal.  Id., at 660, n. 13.\n",
      "     Neither is it a surprise that Chardon acknowledged tolling statutes might come in (at least) these two varieties.  At common law, both types of tolling were well and long known, if often employed in different circumstances to address different problems in equitably tailored ways.\n",
      "     Take the stop clock approach.  While any generalization is subject to its exceptions, the stop clock approach was often used at common law to suspend a plaintiff's duty to bring a timely lawsuit if, and for the period, the plaintiff was prevented from coming to court due to some disability.  And this common law rule made common sense in those circumstances.  After all, if (say) a defendant's fraud prevented the plaintiff from discovering his injury, it's easy enough to see why the limitations clock should stop running until the fraud is revealed and the disability thus dissipated.1\n",
      "     By contrast, the grace period approach was commonly used in cases where, as here, the plaintiff made it to court in time but arrived in the wrong court and had to refile in the right one.  In this situation, equity didn't necessarily call for suspending the running of the limitations period for whatever arbitrary period of time--weeks or months or years--the suit happened to sit in court before dismissal.  It's not as if the defendant or uncontrollable circumstances had conspired to prevent the plaintiff from proceeding during that period.  Instead, the law commonsensically held that in these circumstances a grace period would suffice to allow the plaintiff a brief time to find his way to and refile in the correct court.2\n",
      "     Indeed, grace periods appear to find their roots in a common law rule known as the \"journey's account\" that expressly sought to account for and afford to a dismissed party \"the number of days which [he] must spend in journeying to the court\" to refile his claim.  37 C. J., Limitations of Actions §526, p. 1082 (1925); see E. Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 567 (1642) (reprint 1797) (\"[T]he common law set downe the certaine time of 15 dayes,\" because \"a dayes journey is accounted in law 20 miles,\" as \"a  reasonable time . . . within which time wheresoever the court of justice sate in England, the party . . . wheresoever he dwelt in England . . . might . . . by the said account of dayes journies appeare in court\"); Spencer's Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 267, 267-268 (1603) (party has \"the benefit of a new writ by journeys accompts\" after first writ \"abated\"); Elstob v. Thorowgood, 91 Eng. Rep. 1086, 1087 (1697) (party has 30 days to bring an action \"by journeys account\" to avoid \"the Statute of Limitations\").\n",
      "     When it comes to the statute before us, the textual and contextual clues point in the same and unsurprising direction.  Much like the journey's account from which it originated, section 1367(d)'s \"tolling\" provision seeks to provide the plaintiff who finds her case dismissed because she filed in the wrong court a reasonable grace period to journey to the right court to refile.  No more and no less.\n",
      "     Take the textual clues.  Section 1367(d) says that \"the period of limitations . . . shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"  Note that the law uses the words \"tolled\" and \"tolling\" in the same sentence.  Normally, we assume that when Congress repeats a term in a statute the term's meaning remains constant throughout.  And that assumption is surely \"at its most vigorous\" where, as here, Congress repeats the same term in the same sentence.  Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n",
      "     This traditional rule of construction tells us a great deal. It does because no one doubts that the state law \"tolling period[s]\" referenced in the second half of the sentence were at the time of section 1367(d)'s enactment--and still are--grace periods allowing parties a specified number of days or months after dismissal to refile in the proper court.  See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. §13-80-111 (1990) (providing that the plaintiff \"may commence a new action upon the same cause of action within ninety days after the termination of the original action\").3  In fact, these statutes were often self-consciously patterned on the journey's account doctrine, seeking to address much the same problem the common law faced with much the same solution.4  And the fact that Congress used a variant of the word \"toll\" in the second half of the sentence to refer to grace periods strongly suggests it did so in the first half of the sentence too.  So that the first phrase \"shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days\" should be understood to extend a grace period of 30 days after dismissal much as the second phrase \"tolling period\" is understood to refer the reader to parallel state law grace periods affording short periods for refiling after dismissal.\n",
      "     The alternative reading endorsed by the Court today extends too little respect to Congress's competency as drafter.  It asks us to assume the legislature was so garbled in its expression that it switched the meaning of the term \"toll\" halfway through a single sentence without telling anyone.  It asks us to conclude that when Congress spoke of the period \"tolled\" in the first part of the sentence it meant to refer (unambiguously, no less) to a stop clock approach even though it used the term \"tolling period\" to refer to existing state law grace periods in the second part of the sentence.  The statute's text drops no hint of such a silent switch and it's a lexicographical leap our traditional rules of statutory interpretation warn against.\n",
      "     That, though, represents just the beginning of the textual troubles with the approach the Court adopts.  Consider next the fact that section 1367(d) tells us to apply its federal tolling rule \"unless\" state law provides a \"longer tolling period.\"  In this way, the statute asks us to compare the length of the state \"tolling period\" with the length of the federal \"tolling period\" set by section 1367(d) and apply the longer one.  See ante, at 16 (courts apply the federal rule if \"the state-law tolling period will not be longer than §1367(d)'s\").  The equation we're asked to perform is straightforward and sensible if we understand both the state and federal \"tolling periods\" discussed in this statute as grace periods.  We simply pick the longer grace period: is it the federal 30 day period or one provided by state law?\n",
      "     By contrast, the equation is anything but straightforward or sensible under the Court's approach.  The Court tells us that, under its reading of the statute, the federal \"tolling period\" is the \"duration of the claim's pendency in federal court\" plus 30 days.  See ante, at 12, 15.  So the decision whether to apply the federal or the state tolling period turns not on the sensible question which would afford the plaintiff more time to refile but instead on the happenstance of how long the plaintiff's claim sat in federal court before dismissal.  Under the Court's interpretation, we apply the federal stop clock rule if, but only if, the time the case happened to linger in federal court before dismissal (plus 30 days) is longer than the relevant state grace period.  But to state the test is to see it is a nonsense--one we would not lightly attribute to any rational drafter, let alone Congress.\n",
      "     Consider some examples of the absurdities that follow from the apples-to-oranges comparison the Court's test requires.  Say state law provides a 5 year statute of limitations and a 1 year grace period for refiling.  The plaintiff files in federal court one day before the statute of limitations expires.  The litigation in federal court lasts 1 year.  Under the Court's view, the federal \"tolling period\" would be 1 year plus 30 days--the time the claim was pending in federal court plus 30 days after dismissal.  That period is longer than the state tolling period of 1 year and so the federal tolling rule, not the state rule, controls--leaving the plaintiff only 31 days to refile her claim after dismissal even though state law would have allowed a full year.\n",
      "     That may be curious enough, but curiouser it gets.  Now suppose the litigation in federal court lasts only 10 months.  That makes the federal tolling period only 11 months (10 months plus 30 days).  Under the Court's view, state law now provides a longer tolling period (1 year) and the litigant gets a full year to refile in state court instead of 31 days.  No one has offered a reason why the happenstance of how long the federal litigation lasted should determine how much time a litigant has to refile in state court.  Yet that is what the Court's reading of section 1367(d) demands.\n",
      "     Of course, it's easy enough to imagine the rule the Court really wants to adopt today: it would like to afford litigants as a matter of federal law the benefit of a stop clock approach whenever doing so would yield more time to refile than the state's grace period would permit.  But to accomplish so much we would need a very different statute than the one we have.  We would need to be able to compare the relevant state law grace \"tolling period\" not with the federal \"tolling period\" as the statute says but with the amount of time left under the relevant state limitations period on the date the plaintiff filed her federal suit.  The problem is, no one has even hinted how we might lawfully superimpose all those italicized words (entirely of our own devise) onto the statutory text.5\n",
      "     There are still more textual clues that we have lost our way today.  Congress spoke of the federal tolling period as embracing \"30 days after . . . dismissal.\"  That language sounds like and fits with a traditional grace period or journey's account approach.  As we've seen, grace periods often speak about affording parties some short period of time after dismissal to refile their claims.  Meanwhile, this language proves no small challenge to square with a stop clock approach.  Generally we say a clock is stopped due to the onset of a particular event like a disability: something usually causes the stopping of the clock and when that something goes away, the clock restarts.  Here, the Court says, the clock stops once a claim is pending in federal court.  Yet it doesn't restart when that something--the claim's pendency--goes away but instead waits another 30 days before ticking again.  All without any apparent reason for the additional delay.\n",
      "     This case illustrates the oddity.  The petitioner filed her suit in federal court with 23 months remaining on the three year statute of limitations.  The case remained in federal district court for nearly three years before dismissal.  Under the grace period approach the 30 day provision does just as it appears, providing petitioner with 30 days to journey to and refile in the correct court.  Under the stop clock approach, though, the statute affords the petitioner 23 months plus a random 30 days more to refile.  Indeed, on the stop clock approach the only work the 30 day period is even imaginably left to do comes in cases where the plaintiff filed her federal suit at the very end of the limitations period.  And if that's the only problem Congress sought to address, it chose a mighty murky way to do it, for the parties point to not a single stop clock provision in all of federal law that includes language anything like this.  All while (again) this language fits hand in glove with every grace period statute known.6\n",
      "     Beyond all these textual clues lie important contextual ones too.  When Congress replants the roots of preexisting law in the federal code, this Court assumes it brings with it the surrounding soil, retaining the substance of the tradition it engages.  Respect for Congress, this Court has held, means assuming it knows and \"legislate[s] against a background of [the] common law . . . principles\" found in the field where it is working.  Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U. S. 305, 320, n. 13 (2010); see also Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 184-185 (1988).  And, as we've seen, the state law of tolling Congress expressly referenced and replanted in section 1367(d) comes heavily encrusted with meaning.  In cases involving dismissal and refiling, state statutory law and the common law from which it grew have long afforded a grace period to allow the litigant an appropriately tailored time to find his way to the proper court.  Meanwhile, a stop clock approach isn't usually part of this ecosystem for nothing has disabled the litigant from reaching a court in the first place and all he must do is journey from the old court to the new one.  We don't assume Congress strips replanted statutes of their soil, and we should not assume Congress displaced so much tradition in favor of something comparatively foreign.7\n",
      "     The Court's reformation of the statute introduces another problem still--one of significantly greater magnitude yet.  In our constitutional structure, the federal government's powers are supposed to be \"few and defined,\" while the powers reserved to the States \"remain . . . numerous and indefinite.\"  The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (Madison); McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819).  No doubt, the Constitution affords Congress the authority to make laws that are \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its defined duties.  Art. I, §8, cl. 18.  But it is difficult to see how, on the Court's interpretation, section 1367(d) might be said to survive that test--how it might be said to be necessary and proper to effectuate any recognized federal power or how it could be called anything other than an unconstitutional intrusion on the core state power to define the terms of state law claims litigated in state court proceedings.8\n",
      "     Under our precedent, the analysis here begins with Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456 (2003).  Without some tolling rule for dismissed state law supplemental claims, the Court in Jinks noted, federal courts would be left with \"three basic choices:\" (1) \"condition dismissal of the state-law claim on the defendant's waiver of any statute-of-limitations defense in state court\"; (2) \"retain jurisdiction over the state-law claim even though it would more appropriately be heard in state court\"; or (3) \"dismiss the state-law claim but allow the plaintiff to reopen the fed-eral case if the state court later held the claim to be time barred.\"  Id., at 462-463.  All three choices, the Court held, would negatively affect the \" 'administration of justice' in federal court\" and thus impair the exercise of the enumerated \"judicial power\" of the federal government in Article III.  Id., at 462 (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the Court reasoned, some tolling rule \"assur[ing] that state-law claims asserted under [the supplemental jurisdiction statute] will not become time barred while pending in federal court\" is necessary and proper to the execution of the federal judicial power.  Id., at 464.\n",
      "      The necessary and proper federal interest Jinks recognized is fully discharged by a grace period.  Even petitioner appears to concede this.  See Brief for Petitioner 27 (\"Of course, the grace period approach also guarantees a plaintiff who is unsuccessful in federal court the opportunity to bring a claim in state court\").  Nor could anyone easily argue otherwise.  Jinks itself proceeded to uphold the constitutionality of section 1367(d) as necessary and proper on the basis of an understanding that the statute guaranteed just 30 days to a disappointed litigant to refile in state court.  No one in Jinks even hinted that a longer period might be necessary or proper to serve any valid federal interest.9\n",
      "     For good reason, it turns out.  Trying to imagine how the Court's novel twist on section 1367(d) might serve a necessary and proper federal interest is a hard business.  To discharge the federal interest in preventing state law claims from \"becom[ing] time barred while pending in federal court\" it may be necessary to impose a short grace period.  But how is it necessary to do anything more than that, like consult the happenstance of how long the federal court took to dismiss the case and then tack an equivalent number of months or years onto state law limitations periods?  What federal interest could that even plausibly serve?  The Court does not and cannot attempt an answer because its proffered solution is simply orthogonal to any federal concern.\n",
      "     To be sure, the Court suggests that its approach will help the States.  See ante, at 19.  But a great many States have suggested the opposite, complaining to us that the Court's approach will regularly relegate to the dustbin their own state limitations policy choices.  See Brief for State of Wisconsin et al. as Amici Curiae 22-27; Brief for National Conference of State Legislatures et al. as Amici Curiae 6-29.  And surely they would seem better positioned than we to know their own interests.  To this, the Court replies that \"[w]ere the dissent's position to prevail, cautious plaintiffs would surely\" file \"two actions [one in federal, the other in state court] and ask the state court to hold the suit filed there in abeyance pending disposition of the federal suit,\" causing \"plaintiffs to resort to wasteful, inefficient duplication.\"  Ante, at 19.  But, of course, this observation does nothing to tell us whether stop clock tolling is necessary to serve a federal interest.  Nor does it even tell us whether stop clock tolling is necessary to help the States.  A very long historical record before us suggests that grace periods have worked well to obviate the need for simultaneous filings in state and federal court; the Court offers no account why its innovation might be needed only now to rescue States from their own legislative choices about the appropriate lifespan of their state law claims.\n",
      "     The Court's approach isn't just unnecessary; it isn't proper either.  A law is not \"proper for carrying into [e]xecution\" an enumerated power if it \"violates the principle of state sovereignty\" reflected in our constitutional tradition.  Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 923-924 (1997).  The word \"proper\" was \"used during the founding era to describe the powers of a governmental entity as peculiarly within the province or jurisdiction of that entity.\"  Lawson & Granger, The \"Proper\" Scope of Federal Power: A Jurisdictional Interpretation of the Sweeping Clause, 43 Duke L. J. 267, 297 (1993).  Limitations periods for state law claims fall well within the peculiar province of state sovereign authority.  As Chancellor Kent explained, \" '[t]he period sufficient to constitute a bar to the litigation of sta[l]e demands, is a question of municipal policy and regulation, and one which belongs to the discretion of every government, consulting its own interest and convenience.' \"  Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717, 726 (1988) (quoting 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 462-463 (2d ed. 1832)).  Described as \"laws for administering justice,\" time bars are \"one of the most sacred and important of sovereign rights and duties.\"  Hawkins v. Barney's Lessee, 5 Pet. 457, 466 (1831).  And \"from a remote antiquity,\" they have been the province of the sovereign \"by which it exercises its legislation for all persons and property within its jurisdiction.\"  McElmoyle ex rel. Bailey v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312, 327 (1839).  Our States have long \"exercise[d] this right in virtue of their sovereignty.\"  Ibid.\n",
      "     The decision today gives short shrift to these traditional interests.  Just consider how differently the two approaches treat States when it comes to one of their most \"important of sovereign rights.\"  Under a grace period approach, Congress simply fills a void, for the great bulk of States provide for grace periods of 30 days or longer; only a few States don't allow that much or don't speak to the question.  See n. 3, supra.  So on the grace period account, Congress provides a modest backstop consistent with existing state law.  By contrast, under the stop clock interpretation, state law grace periods are displaced whenever the federal litigation (plus those odd 30 days) happens to be longer than the state law grace period.  And that, of course, is sure to happen often, for federal litigation is no quick business and state law grace periods often are.  Any time federal litigation (plus, again, 30 days) lasts longer than the 30 or 60 or 90 or 365 day grace period found in state law, state law will be forced to give way, and a federally mandated stop clock approach will usurp its place.\n",
      "     The stop clock approach, then, ensures that traditional state law judgments about the appropriate lifespan of state law claims will be routinely displaced--and displaced in favor of nothing more than a fortuity (the time a claim sits in federal court) that bears no rational relationship to any federal interest.  The Court's approach forces state courts to entertain routinely state law claims that the state legislatures treat as no claims at all.  And it forces state courts to entertain claims that aren't just stale by days or weeks under state law, but stale by months or even many years too.  So, for example, take a plaintiff who files suit in federal court shortly after a six year state law limitations period begins running and the litigation lasts six years before it's finally dismissed.  Under the Court's approach, federal law will now promise the plaintiff nearly six years more (plus those stray 30 days again) to refile his claim in state court.  Neither is this illustration fiction; it is drawn from the facts of Berke v. Buckley Broadcasting Corp., 821 A. 2d 118, 121 (N. J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2003).  See also Krause v. Textron Fin. Corp., 2007 WL 8054628, *1-2 (Fla. Cir. Ct. 2007); Brief for State of Wisconsin et al. as Amici Curiae 20-21 (offering many more examples).  Given all this, it's no wonder that 24 States, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments complain that the result the Court reaches today flies in the face of federalism.10\n",
      "     The Court today clears away a fence that once marked a basic boundary between federal and state power.  Maybe it wasn't the most vital fence and maybe we've just simply forgotten why this particular fence was built in the first place.  But maybe, too, we've forgotten because we've wandered so far from the idea of a federal government of limited and enumerated powers that we've begun to lose sight of what it looked like in the first place.  If the federal government can now, without any rational reason, force States to allow state law causes of action in state courts even though the state law limitations period expired many years ago, what exactly can't it do to override the application of state law to state claims in state court?  What boundaries remain then?\n",

In addition to the \"common-law\" stop-the-clock effect, id., at 655, under which the plaintiff must file within the amount of time left in the limitations period, a statute might either provide for the limitations period to be \"renewed,\" so that \"the plaintiff has the benefit of a new period as long as the original,\" or \"establish a fixed period such as six months or one year during which the plaintiff may file suit, without regard to the length of the original limitations period or the amount of time left when tolling began.\"  Id., at 652, n. 1.

See also Black's Law Dictionary 1488 (6th ed. 1990) (\"toll\" can mean \"bar, defeat, or take away; thus, to toll the entry means to deny or take away the right of entry\").  The dissent, also relying on this sense of the word \"toll,\" cites Chardon as support for the proposition that §1367(d)'s tolling instruction is ambiguous.  See post, at 3; supra, at 8, n. 5.  But, importantly, the grace-period statutes noted in Chardon, 462 U. S., at 660, n. 13, were precise about their operation.  Chardon provides no support for the notion that a statute's instruction that a \"period of limitations shall be tolled\" plausibly could mean that the limitations clock continues to run but its effect as a bar is removed during the tolling.  See post, at 2-3.\n",
      "Footnote 10 The District emphasizes that the Reporter's note accompanying the ALI's proposed statute stated: \"[A]ny governing statute of limitations is tolled by the commencement of an action in a federal court, and for at least thirty days following dismissal . . . in any case in which the dismissal was for lack of jurisdiction.\"  ALI Study 66.  The similarity between this language and §1367(d), the District argues, rebuts any argument that Congress did not adopt the ALI's recommendation.  We are unpersuaded.  The District offers no explanation why, if Congress wanted to follow the substance of the ALI's grace-period recommendation, it would neither cite the ALI Study in the legislative history of §1367(d), see infra this page, nor adopt the precise language of either the proposed statute or the Reporter's note.  The ALI Study, moreover, cautions that the Reporter's notes reflect \"the Reporter's work alone,\" not a position taken by the Institute.  ALI Study, p. x.\n",
      "Footnote 11 The dissent offers a history lesson on the ancient common-law principle of \"journey's account,\" see post, at 5-6, and n. 4, but nothing suggests that the 101st Congress had any such ancient law in mind when it drafted §1367(d).  Cf. post, at 9.  More likely, Congress was mindful that \"suspension\" during the pendency of other litigation is \"the common-law rule.\"  Chardon, 462 U. S., at 655.\n",
      "Footnote 12 The dissent, post, at 8-9, conjures up absurdities not presented by this case, for the District of Columbia has no law of the kind the dissent describes.  All agree that the phrase \"unless State law provides for a longer tolling period\" leaves room for a more generous state-law regime.  The dissent posits a comparison between the duration of the federal suit, plus 30 days, and a state-law grace period.  But of course, as the dissent recognizes, post, at 9, the more natural comparison is between the amount of time a plaintiff has left to refile, given the benefit of §1367(d)'s tolling rule, and the amount of time she would have to refile under the applicable state law.  Should the extraordinary circumstances the dissent envisions in fact exist in a given case, the comparison the dissent makes would be far from inevitable.\n",
      "Footnote 13 The dissent refers to an \"understanding,\" post, at 14, by the Court in Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456 (2003), that §1367(d) accords only a 30-day \"window\" for refiling in state court.  Scattered characterizations in the Jinks briefing might be seen as conveying that understanding.  See post, at 14, n. 9.  The opinion itself, however, contains nary a hint of any such understanding.  And indeed, one year earlier, we described §1367(d) as having the effect of stopping the clock, i.e., \"toll[ing] the state statute of limitations for 30 days in addition to however long the claim had been pending in federal court.\"  Raygor v.

      "Footnote 5 In footnote 12 of its opinion, the Court suggests that a comparison between state and federal tolling periods may not be \"inevitable\" and that in \"extraordinary circumstances\" like those discussed above a comparison between the state tolling period and the time left on the clock before the federal filing might prove \"more natural.\"  Ante, at 16, n. 12.  But even here the Court does not attempt to explain how the latter comparison might be fairly extracted from the statutory text--let alone only in \"extraordinary circumstances.\"\n",
      "Footnote 6 The Court offers a couple of competing textual arguments but neither can bear much weight.\n",
      "First, the Court suggests that deriving a grace period from the statutory term \"period of limitations\" requires \"strain[ing].\"  Ante, at 12.  But the fact is both the grace period and stop clock interpretations require some (and some very similar) inferences.  The grace period approach construes the term \"period of limitations\" as directing us to the \"effect of the period of limitations\" that is tolled or taken away.  For its part meanwhile, the stop clock approach construes \"period of limitations\" to refer to the \"running of the period of limitations\" that is tolled or taken away.  The question is which inference is more persuasive.  And in light of the dual kinds of tolling the law has long recognized, as well as the textual and contextual clues before us (some still to be discussed), the better answer is clear.\n",
      "Second, the Court complains that the grace period interpretation renders \"superfluous\" the phrase \"while the claim is pending.\"  Ante, at 12.  But the phrase does important work under the grace period approach, ensuring that the expiration of limitations period does not take effect while the claim is pending in federal court.  Indeed and somewhat paradoxically, the Court itself implicitly recognizes that the language does real work when it suggests (in its next sentence no less) that the grace period approach could \"yield an absurdity\" by working to revive a claim that has already expired before it is brought in federal court.  Ante, at 12-13.  There is of course no absurdity in it, for the term \"while the claim is pending\" does the important work of addressing that very concern, preventing the expiration of the statute of limitations from taking effect while the claim is pending even as the language also and sensibly permits the statute of limitations to take effect if it expires before the plaintiff files his claim in federal court.\n",
      "Footnote 7 The Court dismisses this \"history lesson\" on the ground that it doesn't know if Congress had \"the ancient common-law . . . in mind.\"  Ante, at 14, n. 11.  But respect for Congress's competency means we presume it knows the substance of the state laws it expressly incorporates into its statutes and the common law against which it operates.  See supra, at 11.  When the Court turns to offer its own competing contextual evidence, it observes that a stop clock approach can be found in many other places in the U. S. Code.  See ante, at 7, and n. 4, 15-16.  But it turns out the Court's stop clock examples often involve situations where some disability prevents the plaintiff from proceeding to court.  See, e.g., 26 U. S. C. §6213(f )(1) (limitations period for filing a petition in the Tax Court \"shall be suspended for the period during which the debtor is prohibited . . . from filing a petition\"); §6503(a)(1) (limitations period on making an assessment shall \"be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the assessment\").  Notably, not one of the Court's examples purports to address a situation like the one we face: where the plaintiff has proven able to come to court but merely chosen the wrong one.  The Court's own contextual evidence, then, serves to illustrate just how unusual and out of place a stop clock approach would be here.\n",
      "Footnote 8 Of course, the case before us arises from litigation in the District of Columbia where the federal government enjoys plenary power.  See Art. I, §8, cl. 17.  But the federalism concern here cannot be ignored, as the Court today rightly acknowledges (ante, at 16-19), because the statute at issue applies nationwide and the vast bulk of its applications come in the States and implicate state causes of action, state limitations laws, and state court proceedings.\n",
      "Footnote 9 See Brief for Petitioner in Jinks v. Richland County, O.T. 2002, No. 02-258, p. 9 (\"The tolling window created lasts only 30 days after dismissal without prejudice from district court[.]\"); id., at 37 (section 1367(d) \"provides a de minimis window in which a plaintiff may refile in state court if the limitations period expires during the pendency of the federal district court action\"); Brief for Respondent in No. 02-258, p. 31 (describing section 1367(d) as providing \"a thirty-day tolling window\"); Brief for United States in No. 02-258, pp. 16, 22 (describing section 1367(d) as \"minimally intrusive on state prerogatives\" since it ensures that the \"statute of limitations on the pendent claim will not expire during the pendency of the federal-court action\"); Pet. for Cert. in No. 02-258, p. 22 (\"Section 1367(d) merely saves--for a maximum excess period of 30 days--a preexisting lawsuit that must be refiled to allow the matter to be heard in a forum preferable to the State, namely, in its own courts\"); see also Brief for State of Wisconsin et al. as Amici Curiae 8-9.\n",
      "Footnote 10 The Court's reply--that stop clock tolling is \"standard\" and \"off-the-shelf \"--is no answer.  Ante, at 19.  The propriety of a legal tool in one area does not establish its propriety in all; while stop clock tolling may be standard and off-the-shelf in other contexts (such as for equitable tolling) that doesn't mean it is necessary and proper here.  Indeed, and as we've seen, the \"standard\" and \"off-the-shelf\" solution to the problem of dismissal and the need to refile is the one adopted at common law and by state law: a grace period.  If we're interested in looking for the right shelf, that's the one.\n",

      "Endeavoring to root out corporate fraud, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank).  Both Acts shield whistleblowers from retaliation, but they differ in important respects.  Sarbanes-Oxley applies to all \"employees\" who report misconduct to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission), any other federal agency, Congress, or an internal supervisor.  18 U. S. C. §1514A(a)(1).  Dodd-Frank defines a \"whistleblower\" as \"any individual who provides . . . information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission, in a manner established, by rule or regulation, by the Commission.\"  15 U. S. C. §78u-6(a)(6).  A whistleblower so defined is eligible for an award if original information provided to the SEC leads to a successful enforcement action.  §78u-6(b)-(g).  And he or she is protected from retaliation in three situations, see §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(i)-(iii), including for \"making disclosures that are required or protected under\" Sarbanes-Oxley or other specified laws, §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(iii).  Sarbanes-Oxley's anti-retaliation provision contains an administrative-exhaustion requirement and a 180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, see 18 U. S. C. §1514A(b)(1)(A), (2)(D), whereas Dodd-Frank permits a whistleblower to sue an employer directly in federal district court, with a default six-year limitation period, see §78u-6(h)(1)(B)(i), (iii)(I)(aa).\n",
      "          The SEC's regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank provision contain two discrete whistleblower definitions.  For purposes of the award program, Rule 21F-2 requires a whistleblower to \"provide the Commission with information\" relating to possible securities-law violations.  17 CFR §240.21F-2(a)(1).  For purposes of the anti-retaliation protections, however, the Rule does not require SEC reporting.  See §240.21F-2(b)(1)(i)-(ii).\n",
      "          Respondent Paul Somers alleges that petitioner Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (Digital Realty) terminated his employment shortly after he reported to senior management suspected securities-law violations by the company.  Somers filed suit, alleging, inter alia, a claim of whistleblower retaliation under Dodd-Frank.  Digital Realty moved to dismiss that claim on the ground that Somers was not a whistleblower under §78u-6(h) because he did not alert the SEC prior to his termination.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals concluded that §78u-6(h) does not necessitate recourse to the SEC prior to gaining \"whistleblower\" status, and it accorded deference to the SEC's regulation under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837.\n",
      "Held: Dodd-Frank's anti-retaliation provision does not extend to an individual, like Somers, who has not reported a violation of the securities laws to the SEC.  Pp. 9-19.\n",
      "     (a) A statute's explicit definition must be followed, even if it varies from a term's ordinary meaning.  Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130.  Section 78u-6(a) instructs that the statute's definition of \"whistleblower\" \"shall apply\" \"[i]n this section,\" that is, throughout §78u-6.  The Court must therefore interpret the term \"whistleblower\" in §78u-6(h), the anti-retaliation provision, in accordance with that definition.\n",
      "     The whistleblower definition operates in conjunction with the three clauses of §78u-6(h)(1)(A) to spell out the provision's scope.  The definition first describes who is eligible for protection--namely, a \"whistleblower\" who provides pertinent information \"to the Commission.\"  §78u-6(a)(6).  The three clauses then describe what conduct, when engaged in by a \"whistleblower,\" is shielded from employment discrimination.  An individual who meets both measures may invoke Dodd-Frank's protections.  But an individual who falls outside the protected category of \"whistleblowers\" is ineligible to seek redress under the statute, regardless of the conduct in which that individual engages.  This reading is reinforced by another whistleblower-protection provision in Dodd-Frank, see 12 U. S. C. §5567(b), which imposes no requirement that information be conveyed to a government agency.  Pp. 9-11.\n",
      "     (b) The Court's understanding is corroborated by Dodd-Frank's purpose and design.  The core objective of Dodd-Frank's whistleblower program is to aid the Commission's enforcement efforts by \"motivat[ing] people who know of securities law violations to tell the SEC.\"  S. Rep. No. 111-176, p. 38 (emphasis added).  To that end, Congress provided monetary awards to whistleblowers who furnish actionable information to the Commission.  Congress also complemented the financial incentives for SEC reporting by heightening protection against retaliation.  Pp. 11-12.\n",
      "     (c) Somers and the Solicitor General contend that Dodd-Frank's \"whistleblower\" definition applies only to the statute's award program and not, as the definition plainly states, to its anti-retaliation provision.  Their concerns do not support a departure from the statutory text.  Pp. 12-18.\n",
      "          (1) They claim that the Court's reading would vitiate the protections of clause (iii) for whistleblowers who make disclosures to persons and entities other than the SEC.  See §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(iii).  But the plain-text reading of the statute leaves the third clause with substantial meaning by protecting a whistleblower who reports misconduct both to the SEC and to another entity, but suffers retaliation because of the latter, non-SEC, disclosure.  Pp. 13-15.\n",
      "          (2) Nor would the Court's reading jettison protections for auditors, attorneys, and other employees who are required to report information within the company before making external disclosures.  Such employees would be shielded as soon as they also provide relevant information to the Commission.  And Congress may well have considered adequate the safeguards already afforded to such employees by Sarbanes-Oxley.  Pp. 15-16.\n",
      "          (3) Applying the \"whistleblower\" definition as written, Somers and the Solicitor General further protest, will allow \"identical misconduct\" to \"go punished or not based on the happenstance of a separate report\" to the SEC.  Brief for Respondent 37-38.  But it is understandable that the statute's retaliation protections, like its financial rewards, would be reserved for employees who have done what Dodd-Frank seeks to achieve by reporting information about unlawful activity to the SEC.  P. 16.\n",
      "          (4) The Solicitor General observes that the statute contains no apparent requirement of a \"temporal or topical connection between the violation reported to the Commission and the internal disclosure for which the employee suffers retaliation.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25.  The Court need not dwell on related hypotheticals, which veer far from the case at hand.  Pp. 16-18.\n",
      "          (5) Finally, the interpretation adopted here would not undermine clause (ii) of §78u-6(h)(1)(A), which prohibits retaliation against a whistleblower for \"initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investigation or . . . action of the Commission based upon\" information conveyed to the SEC by a whistleblower in accordance with the statute.  The statute delegates authority to the Commission to establish the \"manner\" in which a whistleblower may provide information to the SEC.  §78u-6(a)(6).  Nothing prevents the Commission from enumerating additional means of SEC reporting, including through testimony protected by clause (ii).  P. 18.\n",
      "     (d) Because \"Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\" Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842, deference is not accorded to the contrary view advanced by the SEC in Rule 21F-2.  Pp. 18-19.\n",

      "     Endeavoring to root out corporate fraud, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 745 (Sarbanes-Oxley), and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 124 Stat. 1376 (Dodd-Frank).  Both Acts shield whistleblowers from retaliation, but they differ in important respects.  Most notably, Sarbanes-Oxley applies to all \"employees\" who report misconduct to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission), any other federal agency, Congress, or an internal supervisor.  18 U. S. C. §1514A(a)(1).  Dodd-Frank delineates a more circumscribed class; it defines \"whistleblower\" to mean a person who provides \"information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.\"  15 U. S. C. §78u-6(a)(6).  A whistleblower so defined is eligible for an award if original information he or she provides to the SEC leads to a successful enforcement action.  §78u-6(b)-(g).  And, most relevant here, a whistleblower is protected from retaliation for, inter alia, \"making disclosures that are required or protected under\" Sarbanes-Oxley, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the criminal anti-retaliation proscription at 18 U. S. C. §1513(e), or any other  law subject to the SEC's jurisdiction.  15 U. S. C.   §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(iii).\n",
      "     The question presented: Does the anti-retaliation provision of Dodd-Frank extend to an individual who has not reported a violation of the securities laws to the SEC and therefore falls outside the Act's definition of \"whistleblower\"?  Pet. for Cert. (I).  We answer that question \"No\": To sue under Dodd-Frank's anti-retaliation provision, a person must first \"provid[e] . . . information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.\"   §78u-6(a)(6).\n",

      "A\n",
      "     \"To safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation,\" Congress enacted Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002.  Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U. S. 429, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 1).  Most pertinent here, Sarbanes-Oxley created new protections for employees at risk of retaliation for reporting corporate misconduct.  See 18 U. S. C. §1514A.  Section 1514A prohibits certain companies from discharging or otherwise \"discriminat[ing] against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because\" the employee \"provid[es] information . . . or otherwise assist[s] in an investigation regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation\" of certain criminal fraud statutes, any SEC rule or regulation, or \"any provision of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders.\"  §1514A(a)(1).  An employee qualifies for protection when he or she provides information or assistance either to a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, Congress, or any \"person with supervisory authority over the employee.\"  §1514A(a)(1)(A)-(C).1\n",
      "     To recover under §1514A, an aggrieved employee must exhaust administrative remedies by \"filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor.\"  §1514A(b)(1)(A); see Lawson, 571 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 5-6).  Congress prescribed a 180-day limitation period for filing such a complaint.  §1514A(b)(2)(D).  If the agency \"does not issue a final decision within 180 days of the filing of [a] complaint, and the [agency's] delay is not due to bad faith on the claimant's part, the claimant may proceed to federal district court for de novo review.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (citing §1514A(b)).  An employee who prevails in a proceeding under §1514A is \"entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole,\" including reinstatement, backpay with interest, and any \"special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination,\" among such damages, litigation costs.  §1514A(c).\n",

      "     At issue in this case is the Dodd-Frank anti-retaliation provision enacted in 2010, eight years after the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley.  Passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Dodd-Frank aimed to \"promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system.\"  124 Stat. 1376.\n",
      "     Dodd-Frank responded to numerous perceived shortcomings in financial regulation.  Among them was the SEC's need for additional \"power, assistance and money at its disposal\" to regulate securities markets.  S. Rep. No. 111-176, pp. 36, 37 (2010).  To assist the Commission \"in identifying securities law violations,\" the Act established \"a new, robust whistleblower program designed to motivate people who know of securities law violations to tell the SEC.\"  Id., at 38.  And recognizing that \"whistleblowers often face the difficult choice between telling the truth and . . . committing 'career suicide,' \" Congress sought to protect whistleblowers from employment discrimination.  Id., at 111, 112.\n",
      "     Dodd-Frank implemented these goals by adding a new provision to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: 15 U. S. C. §78u-6.  Section 78u-6 begins by defining a \"whistleblower\" as \"any individual who provides . . . information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission, in a manner established, by rule or regulation, by the Commission.\"  §78u-6(a)(6) (emphasis  added).  That definition, the statute directs, \"shall apply\" \"[i]n this section\"--i.e., throughout §78u-6.  §78u-6(a).\n",
      "     Section 78u-6 affords covered whistleblowers both incentives and protection.  First, the section creates an award program for \"whistleblowers who voluntarily provid[e] original information to the Commission that le[ads] to the successful enforcement of [a] covered judicial or administrative action.\"  §78u-6(b)(1).  A qualifying whistleblower is entitled to a cash award of 10 to 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected in the enforcement action.  See §78u-6(b)(1)(A)-(B).\n",
      "     Second, §78u-6(h) prohibits an employer from discharging, harassing, or otherwise discriminating against a \"whistleblower\" \"because of any lawful act done by the whistleblower\" in three situations: first, \"in providing information to the Commission in accordance with [§78u-6],\" §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(i); second, \"in initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investigation or . . . action of the Commission based upon\" information provided to the SEC in accordance with §78u-6, §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(ii); and third, \"in making disclosures that are required or protected under\" either Sarbanes-Oxley, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the criminal anti-retaliation prohibition at 18 U. S. C. §1513(e),2 or \"any other law, rule, or regulation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission,\" §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(iii).  Clause (iii), by cross-referencing Sarbanes-Oxley and other laws, protects disclosures made to a variety of individuals and entities in addition to the SEC.  For example, the clause shields an employee's reports of wrongdoing to an internal supervisor if the reports are independently safeguarded from retaliation under Sarbanes-Oxley.  See supra, at 2-3.3\n",
      "     The recovery procedures under the anti-retaliation provisions of Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley differ in critical respects.  First, unlike Sarbanes-Oxley, which contains an administrative-exhaustion requirement and a 180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, see 18 U. S. C. §1514A(b)(1)(A), (2)(D), Dodd-Frank permits a whistleblower to sue a current or former employer directly in federal district court, with a default limitation period of six years, see §78u-6(h)(1)(B)(i), (iii)(I)(aa).  Second, Dodd-Frank instructs a court to award to a prevailing plaintiff double backpay with interest, see §78u-6(h)(1)(C)(ii), while Sarbanes-Oxley limits recovery to actual backpay with interest, see 18 U. S. C. §1514A(c)(2)(B).  Like Sarbanes-Oxley, however, Dodd-Frank authorizes reinstatement and compensation for litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees.  Compare §78u-6(h)(1)(C)(i), (iii), with 18 U. S. C. §1514A(c)(2)(A), (C).4\n",
      "2\n",
      "     Congress authorized the SEC \"to issue such rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of [§78u-6] consistent with the purposes of this section.\"  §78u-6(j).  Pursuant to this authority, the SEC published a notice of proposed rulemaking to \"Implemen[t] the Whistleblower Provisions\" of Dodd-Frank.  75 Fed. Reg. 70488 (2010).  Proposed Rule 21F-2(a) defined a \"whistleblower,\" for purposes of both the award and anti-retaliation provisions of §78u-6, as one or more individuals who \"provide the Commission with information relating to a potential violation of the securities laws.\"  Id., at 70519 (proposed 17 CFR §240.21F-2(a)).  The proposed rule, the agency noted, \"tracks the statutory definition of a 'whistleblower' \" by requiring information reporting to the SEC itself.  75 Fed. Reg. 70489.\n",
      "     In promulgating the final Rule, however, the agency changed course.  Rule 21F-2, in finished form, contains two discrete \"whistleblower\" definitions.  See 17 CFR §240.21F-2(a)-(b) (2017).  For purposes of the award program, the Rule states that \"[y]ou are a whistleblower if . . . you provide the Commission with information . . . relat[ing] to a possible violation of the Federal securities laws.\"  §240.21F-2(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The information must be provided to the SEC through its website or by mailing or faxing a specified form to the SEC Office of the Whistleblower.  See ibid.; §240.21F-9(a)(1)-(2).\n",
      "     \"For purposes of the anti-retaliation protections,\" however, the Rule states that \"[y]ou are a whistleblower if . . . [y]ou possess a reasonable belief that the information you are providing relates to a possible securities law violation\" and \"[y]ou provide that information in a manner described in\" clauses (i) through (iii) of §78u-6(h)(1)(A).  17 CFR §240.21F-2(b)(1)(i)-(ii).  \"The anti-retaliation protections apply,\" the Rule emphasizes, \"whether or not you satisfy the requirements, procedures and conditions to qualify for an award.\"  §240.21F-2(b)(1)(iii).  An individual may therefore gain anti-retaliation protection as a \"whistleblower\" under Rule 21F-2 without providing information to the SEC, so long as he or she provides information in a manner shielded by one of the anti-retaliation provision's three clauses.  For example, a report to a company supervisor would qualify if the report garners protection under the Sarbanes-Oxley anti-retaliation provision.5\n",

      "     Petitioner Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (Digital Realty) is a real estate investment trust that owns, acquires, and develops data centers.  See Brief for Petitioner 3.  Digital Realty employed respondent Paul Somers as a Vice President from 2010 to 2014.  See 119 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1092 (ND Cal. 2015).  Somers alleges that Digital Realty terminated him shortly after he reported to senior management suspected securities-law violations by the company.  See ibid.  Although nothing impeded him from alerting the SEC prior to his termination, he did not do so.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.  Nor did he file an administrative complaint within 180 days of his termination, rendering him ineligible for relief under Sarbanes-Oxley.  See ibid.; 18 U. S. C. §1514A(b)(2)(D).\n",
      "     Somers brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging, inter alia, a claim of whistleblower retaliation under Dodd-Frank.  Digital Realty moved to dismiss that claim, arguing that \"Somers does not qualify as a 'whistleblower' under [§78u-6(h)] because he did not report any alleged law violations to the SEC.\"  119 F. Supp. 3d, at 1094.  The District Court denied the motion.  Rule 21F-2, the court observed, does not necessitate recourse to the SEC prior to gaining \"whistleblower\" status under Dodd-Frank.  See id., at 1095-1096.  Finding the statutory scheme ambiguous, the court accorded deference to the SEC's Rule under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).  See 119 F. Supp. 3d, at 1096-1106.\n",
      "     On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  850 F. 3d 1045 (2017).  The majority acknowledged that Dodd-Frank's definitional provision describes a \"whistleblower\" as an individual who provides information to the SEC itself.  Id., at 1049.  But applying that definition to the anti-retaliation provision, the majority reasoned, would narrow the third clause of §78u-6(h)(1)(A) \"to the point of absurdity\": The statute would protect employees only if they \"reported possible securities violations both internally and to the SEC.\"  Ibid.  Such dual reporting, the majority believed, was unlikely to occur.  Ibid.  Therefore, the majority concluded, the statute should be read to protect employees who make disclosures privileged by clause (iii) of §78u-6(h)(1)(A), whether or not those employees also provide information to the SEC.  Id., at 1050.  In any event, the majority held, the SEC's resolution of any statutory ambiguity warranted deference.  Ibid.  Judge Owens dissented.  In his view, the statutory definition of whistleblower was clear, left no room for interpretation, and plainly governed.  Id., at 1051.\n",
      "     Two other Courts of Appeals have weighed in on the question before us.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that employees must provide information to the SEC to avail themselves of Dodd-Frank's anti-retaliation safeguard.  See Asadi v. G. E. Energy (USA), L. L. C., 720 F. 3d 620, 630 (2013).  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reached the opposite conclusion, over a dissent by Judge Jacobs.  See Berman v. NEO@OGILVY LLC, 801 F. 3d 145, 155 (2013).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict, 582 U. S. ___ (2017), and now reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment.\n",
      "II\n",
      "     \"When a statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition,\" even if it varies from a term's ordinary meaning.  Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This principle resolves the question before us.\n",
      "A\n",
      "     Our charge in this review proceeding is to determine the meaning of \"whistleblower\" in §78u-6(h), Dodd-Frank's anti-retaliation provision.  The definition section of the statute supplies an unequivocal answer: A \"whistleblower\" is \"any individual who provides . . . information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.\"  §78u-6(a)(6) (emphasis added).  Leaving no doubt as to the definition's reach, the statute instructs that the \"definitio[n] shall apply\" \"[i]n this section,\" that is, throughout §78u-6.  §78u-6(a)(6).\n",
      "     The whistleblower definition operates in conjunction with the three clauses of §78u-6(h)(1)(A) to spell out the provision's scope.  The definition first describes who is eligible for protection--namely, a whistleblower who provides pertinent information \"to the Commission.\"  §78u-6(a)(6).  The three clauses of §78u-6(h)(1)(A) then describe what conduct, when engaged in by a whistleblower, is shielded from employment discrimination.  See §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(i)-(iii).  An individual who meets both measures may invoke Dodd-Frank's protections.  But an individual who falls outside the protected category of \"whistleblowers\" is ineligible to seek redress under the statute, regardless of the conduct in which that individual engages.\n",
      "     Reinforcing our reading, another whistleblower-protection provision in Dodd-Frank imposes no requirement that information be conveyed to a government agency.  Title 10 of the statute, which created the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), prohibits discrimination against a \"covered employee\" who, among other things, \"provide[s] . . . information to [his or her] employer, the Bureau, or any other State, local, or Federal, government authority or law enforcement agency relating to\" a violation of a law subject to the CFPB's jurisdiction.  12 U. S. C. §5567(a)(1).  To qualify as a \"covered employee,\" an individual need not provide information to the CFPB, or any other entity.  See §5567(b) (\"covered employee\" means \"any individual performing tasks related to the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or service\").\n",
      "     \"[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another[,] . . . this Court presumes that Congress intended a difference in meaning.\"  Loughrin v. United States, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  Congress placed a government-reporting requirement in §78u-6(h), but not elsewhere in the same statute.  Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition--tell the SEC--Congress imposed.\n",
      "B\n",
      "     Dodd-Frank's purpose and design corroborate our comprehension of §78u-6(h)'s reporting requirement.  The \"core objective\" of Dodd-Frank's robust whistleblower program, as Somers acknowledges, Tr. of Oral Arg. 45, is \"to motivate people who know of securities law violations to tell the SEC,\" S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 38 (emphasis added).  By enlisting whistleblowers to \"assist the Government [in] identify[ing] and prosecut[ing] persons who have violated securities laws,\" Congress undertook to improve SEC enforcement and facilitate the Commission's \"recover[y] [of] money for victims of financial fraud.\"  Id., at 110.  To that end, §78u-6 provides substantial monetary rewards to whistleblowers who furnish actionable information to the SEC.  See §78u-6(b).\n",
      "     Financial inducements alone, Congress recognized, may be insufficient to encourage certain employees, fearful of employer retaliation, to come forward with evidence of wrongdoing.  Congress therefore complemented the Dodd-Frank monetary incentives for SEC reporting by heightening protection against retaliation.  While Sarbanes-Oxley contains an administrative-exhaustion requirement, a 180-day administrative complaint-filing deadline, and a remedial scheme limited to actual damages, Dodd-Frank provides for immediate access to federal court, a generous statute of limitations (at least six years), and the opportunity to recover double backpay.  See supra, at 5-6.  Dodd-Frank's award program and anti-retaliation provision thus work synchronously to motivate individuals with knowledge of illegal activity to \"tell the SEC.\"  S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 38.\n",
      "     When enacting Sarbanes-Oxley's whistleblower regime, in comparison, Congress had a more far-reaching objective: It sought to disturb the \"corporate code of silence\" that \"discourage[d] employees from reporting fraudulent behavior not only to the proper authorities, such as the FBI and the SEC, but even internally.\"  Lawson, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, the Sarbanes-Oxley anti-retaliation provision covers employees who report fraud not only to the SEC, but also to any other federal agency, Congress, or an internal supervisor.  See 18 U. S. C. §1514A(a)(1).\n",
      "C\n",
      "     In sum, Dodd-Frank's text and purpose leave no doubt that the term \"whistleblower\" in §78u-6(h) carries the meaning set forth in the section's definitional provision.  The disposition of this case is therefore evident: Somers did not provide information \"to the Commission\" before his termination, §78u-6(a)(6), so he did not qualify as a \"whistleblower\" at the time of the alleged retaliation.  He is therefore ineligible to seek relief under §78u-6(h).\n",
      "III\n",
      "     Somers and the Solicitor General tender a different view of Dodd-Frank's compass.  The whistleblower definition, as they see it, applies only to the statute's award program, not to its anti-retaliation provision, and thus not, as the definition plainly states, throughout \"this section,\" §78u-6(a).  See Brief for Respondent 30; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10-11.  For purposes of the anti-retaliation provision alone, they urge us to construe the term \"whistleblower\" in its \"ordinary sense,\" i.e., without any SEC-reporting requirement.  Brief for Respondent 18.\n",
      "     Doing so, Somers and the Solicitor General contend, would align with our precedent, specifically Lawson v. Suwannee Fruit & S. S. Co., 336 U. S. 198 (1949), and Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. ___ (2014).  In those decisions, we declined to apply a statutory definition that ostensibly governed where doing so would have been \"incompatible with . . . Congress' regulatory scheme,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks omitted), or would have \"destroy[ed] one of the [statute's] major purposes,\" Suwannee Fruit, 336 U. S., at 201.\n",
      "     This case is of a piece, Somers and the Solicitor General maintain.  Applying the statutory definition here, they variously charge, would \"create obvious incongruities,\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19 (internal quotation marks omitted), \"produce anomalous results,\" id., at 22, \"vitiate much of the [statute's] protection,\" id., at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted), and, as the Court of Appeals put it, narrow clause (iii) of §78u-6(h)(1)(A) \"to the point of absurdity,\" Brief for Respondent 35 (quoting 850 F. 3d, at 1049).  We next address these concerns and explain why they do not lead us to depart from the statutory text.\n",
      "A\n",
      "     It would gut \"much of the protection afforded by\" the third clause of §78u-6(h)(1)(a), Somers and the Solicitor General urge most strenuously, to apply the whistleblower definition to the anti-retaliation provision.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20 (internal quotation marks omitted); Brief for Respondent 28-29.  As earlier noted, see supra, at 4-5, clause (iii) prohibits retaliation against a \"whistleblower\" for \"making disclosures\" to various persons and entities, including but not limited to the SEC, to the extent those disclosures are \"required or protected under\" various laws other than Dodd-Frank.  §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(iii).  Applying the statutory definition of whistleblower, however, would limit clause (iii)'s protection to \"only those individuals who report to the Commission.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22.\n",
      "     The plain-text reading of the statute undoubtedly shields fewer individuals from retaliation than the alternative proffered by Somers and the Solicitor General.  But we do not agree that this consequence \"vitiate[s]\" clause (iii)'s protection, id., at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted), or ranks as \"absur[d],\" Brief for Respondent 35 (internal quotation marks omitted).6  In fact, our reading leaves the third clause with \"substantial meaning.\"  Brief for Petitioner 32.\n",
      "     With the statutory definition incorporated, clause (iii) protects a whistleblower who reports misconduct both to the SEC and to another entity, but suffers retaliation because of the latter, non-SEC, disclosure.  That would be so, for example, where the retaliating employer is unaware that the employee has alerted the SEC.  In such a case, without clause (iii), retaliation for internal reporting would not be reached by Dodd-Frank, for clause (i) applies only where the employer retaliates against the employee \"because of\" the SEC reporting.  §78u-6(h)(1)(A).  Moreover, even where the employer knows of the SEC reporting, the third clause may operate to dispel a proof problem: The employee can recover under the statute without having to demonstrate whether the retaliation was motivated by the internal report (thus yielding protection under clause (iii)) or by the SEC disclosure (thus gaining protection under clause (i)).\n",
      "     While the Solicitor General asserts that limiting the protections of clause (iii) to dual reporters would \"shrink to insignificance the [clause's] ban on retaliation,\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (internal quotation marks omitted), he offers scant evidence to support that assertion.  Tugging in the opposite direction, he reports that approximately 80 percent of the whistleblowers who received awards in 2016 \"reported internally before reporting to the Commission.\"  Id., at 23.  And Digital Realty cites real-world examples of dual reporters seeking Dodd-Frank or Sarbanes-Oxley recovery for alleged retaliation.  See Brief for Petitioner 33, and n. 4 (collecting cases).  Overlooked by Somers and the Solicitor General, in dual-reporting cases, retaliation not prompted by SEC disclosures (and thus unaddressed by clause (i)) is likely commonplace: The SEC is required to protect the identity of whistleblowers, see §78u-6(h)(2)(A), so employers will often be unaware that an employee has reported to the Commission.  In any event, even if the number of individuals qualifying for protection under clause (iii) is relatively limited, \"[i]t is our function to give the statute the effect its language suggests, however modest that may be.\"  Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. 247, 270 (2010).\n",
      "B\n",
      "     Somers and the Solicitor General express concern that our reading would jettison protection for auditors, attorneys, and other employees subject to internal-reporting requirements.  See Brief for Respondent 35; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21.  Sarbanes-Oxley, for example, requires auditors and attorneys to report certain information within the company before making disclosures externally.  See 15 U. S. C. §§78j-1(b), 7245; 17 CFR §205.3.  If the whistleblower definition applies, Somers and the Solicitor General fear, these professionals will be \"le[ft] . . . vulnerable to discharge or other retaliatory action for complying with\" their internal-reporting obligations.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n",
      "     Our reading shields employees in these circumstances, however, as soon as they also provide relevant information to the Commission.  True, such employees will remain ineligible for Dodd-Frank's protection until they tell the SEC, but this result is consistent with Congress' aim to encourage SEC disclosures.  See S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 38; supra, at 3-4, 11.  Somers worries that lawyers and auditors will face retaliation quickly, before they have a chance to report to the SEC.  Brief for Respondent 35-36.  But he offers nothing to show that Congress had this concern in mind when it enacted §78u-6(h).  Indeed, Congress may well have considered adequate the safeguards already afforded by Sarbanes-Oxley, protections specifically designed to shield lawyers, accountants, and similar professionals.  See Lawson, 571 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,  at 17).\n",
      "C\n",
      "     Applying the whistleblower definition as written, Somers and the Solicitor General further protest, will create \"an incredibly unusual statutory scheme\": \"[I]dentical misconduct\"--i.e., retaliating against an employee for internal reporting--will \"go punished or not based on the happenstance of a separate report\" to the SEC, of which the wrongdoer may \"not even be aware.\"  Brief for Respondent 37-38.  See also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.  The upshot, the Solicitor General warns, \"would [be] substantially diminish[ed] Dodd-Fran[k] deterrent effect.\"  Ibid.\n",
      "     Overlooked in this protest is Dodd-Frank's core objective: to prompt reporting to the SEC.  Supra, at 3-4, 11.  In view of that precise aim, it is understandable that the statute's retaliation protections, like its financial rewards, would be reserved for employees who have done what Dodd-Frank seeks to achieve, i.e., they have placed information about unlawful activity before the Commission to aid its enforcement efforts.\n",
      "D\n",
      "     Pointing to another purported anomaly attending the reading we adopt today, the Solicitor General observes that neither the whistleblower definition nor §78u-6(h) contains any requirement of a \"temporal or topical connection between the violation reported to the Commission and the internal disclosure for which the employee suffers retaliation.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25.  It is therefore possible, the Solicitor General posits, that \"an employee who was fired for reporting accounting fraud to his supervisor in 2017 would have a cause of action under [§78u-6(h)] if he had reported an insider-trading violation by his previous employer to the Commission in 2012.\"  Ibid.  For its part, Digital Realty agrees that this scenario could arise, but does not see it as a cause for concern: \"Congress,\" it states, \"could reasonably have made the policy judgment that individuals who report securities-law violations to the SEC should receive broad protection over time against retaliation for a variety of disclosures.\"  Reply Brief 11.\n",
      "     We need not dwell on the situation hypothesized by the Solicitor General, for it veers far from the case before us.  We note, however, that the interpretation offered by Somers and the Solicitor General--i.e., ignoring the statutory definition when construing the anti-retaliation provision--raises an even thornier question about the law's scope.  Their view, which would not require an employee to provide information relating to a securities-law violation to the SEC, could afford Dodd-Frank protection to an employee who reports information bearing no relationship whatever to the securities laws.  That prospect could be imagined based on the broad array of federal statutes and regulations cross-referenced by clause (iii) of the anti-retaliation provision.  E.g., 18 U. S. C. §1513(e) (criminalizing retaliation for \"providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission . . . of any Federal offense\" (emphasis added)); see supra, at 5, and n. 2.  For example, an employee fired for reporting a coworker's drug dealing to the Federal Bureau of Investigation might be protected.  Brief for Petitioner 38.  It would make scant sense, however, to rank an FBI drug-trafficking informant a whistleblower under Dodd-Frank, a law concerned only with encouraging the reporting of \"securities law violations.\"  S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 38 (emphasis added).\n",
      "E\n",
      "     Finally, the interpretation we adopt, the Solicitor General adds, would undermine not just clause (iii) of §78u-6(h)(1)(A), but clause (ii) as well.  Clause (ii) prohibits retaliation against a whistleblower for \"initiating, testifying in, or assisting in any investigation or . . . action of the Commission based upon\" information conveyed to the SEC by a whistleblower in accordance with the statute.  §78u-6(h)(1)(A)(ii).  If the whistleblower definition is applied to §78u-6(h), the Solicitor General states, \"an employer could fire an employee for giving . . . testimony [to the SEC] if the employee had not previously reported to the Commission online or through the specified written form\"--i.e., the methods currently prescribed by Rule 21F-9 for a whistleblower to provide information to the Commission.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20-21 (citing 17 CFR §240.21F-9(a)(1)-(2)).\n",
      "     But the statute expressly delegates authority to the SEC to establish the \"manner\" in which information may be provided to the Commission by a whistleblower.  See §78u-6(a)(6).  Nothing in today's opinion prevents the agency from enumerating additional means of SEC reporting--including through testimony protected by clause (ii).\n",
      "IV\n",
      "     For the foregoing reasons, we find the statute's definition of \"whistleblower\" clear and conclusive.  Because \"Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\" Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842, we do not accord deference to the contrary view advanced by the SEC in Rule 21F-2.  See 17 CFR §240.21F-2(b)(1); supra, at 6-7.  The statute's unambiguous whistleblower definition, in short, precludes the Commission from more expansively interpreting that term.

United States, 469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) (\"In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature's intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which 'represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those Congressmen involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation' \" (quoting Zuber v. Allen, 396 U. S. 168, 186 (1969))).  Bills presented to Congress for consideration are generally accompanied by a committee report.  Such reports are typically circulated at least two days before a bill is to be considered on the floor and provide Members of Congress and their staffs with information about \"a bill's context, purposes, policy implications, and details,\" along with information on its supporters and opponents.  R. Katzmann, Judging Statutes 20, and n. 62 (2014) (citing A. LaRue, Senate Manual Containing the Standing Rules, Orders, Laws, and Resolutions Affecting the Business of the United States Senate, S. Doc. No. 107-1, p. 17 (2001)).  These materials \"have long been important means of informing the whole chamber about proposed legislation,\" Katzmann, Judging Statutes, at 19, a point Members themselves have emphasized over the years.*  It is thus no surprise that legislative staffers view committee and conference reports as the most reliable type of legislative history.  See Gluck & Bressman, Statutory Interpretation From the Inside--An Empirical Study of Congressional Drafting, Delegation and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan. L. Rev. 901, 977 (2013).\n",
      "     Legislative history can be particularly helpful when a statute is ambiguous or deals with especially complex matters.  But even when, as here, a statute's meaning can clearly be discerned from its text, consulting reliable legislative history can still be useful, as it enables us to corroborate and fortify our understanding of the text.  See, e.g., Tapia v. United States, 564 U. S. 319, 331-332 (2011); Carr v. United States, 560 U. S. 438, 457-458 (2010).  Moreover, confirming our construction of a statute by considering reliable legislative history shows respect for and promotes comity with a coequal branch of Government.  See Katzmann, Judging Statutes, at 35-36.\n",
      "     For these reasons, I do not think it wise for judges to close their eyes to reliable legislative history--and the realities of how Members of Congress create and enact laws--when it is available.\n",

The question in this case is whether the term \"whistleblower\" in Dodd-Frank's antiretaliation provision, 15 U. S. C. §78u-6(h)(1), includes a person who does not report information to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The answer is in the definitions section of the statute, which states that the term \"whistleblower\" means a person who provides \"information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.\"  §78u-6(a)(6).  As the Court observes, this statutory definition \"resolves the question before us.\"  Ante, at 9.  The Court goes on, however, to discuss the supposed \"purpose\" of the statute, which it primarily derives from a single Senate Report.  See ante, at 3-4, 11-12, 16-18.

      "          Valley View Downs, LP, and Bedford Downs Management Corp. entered into an agreement under which Valley View, if it got the last harness-racing license in Pennsylvania, would purchase all of Bedford Downs' stock for $55 million.  Valley View was granted the license and arranged for the Cayman Islands branch of Credit Suisse to wire $55 million to third-party escrow agent Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania.  The Bedford Downs shareholders, including petitioner Merit Management Group, LP, deposited their stock certificates into escrow.  Citizens Bank disbursed the $55 million over two installments according to the agreement, of which petitioner Merit received $16.5 million.\n",
      "          Although Valley View secured the harness-racing license, it was unable to achieve its goal of opening a racetrack casino.  Valley View and its parent company, Centaur, LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Respondent FTI Consulting, Inc., was appointed to serve as trustee of the Centaur litigation trust.  FTI then sought to avoid the transfer from Valley View to Merit for the sale of Bedford Downs' stock, arguing that it was constructively fraudulent under §548(a)(1)(B).  Merit contended that the §546(e) safe harbor barred FTI from avoiding the transfer because it was a \"settlement payment . . . made by or to (or for the benefit of)\" two \"financial institutions,\" Credit Suisse and Citizens Bank.  The District Court agreed with Merit, but the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that §546(e) did not protect transfers in which financial institutions served as mere conduits.\n",
      "Held: The only relevant transfer for purposes of the §546(e) safe harbor is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.  Pp. 9-19.\n",
      "     (a) Before a court can determine whether a transfer was \"made by or to (or for the benefit of)\" a covered entity, it must first identify the relevant transfer to test in that inquiry.  Merit posits that the relevant transfer should include not only the Valley-View-to-Merit end-to-end transfer, but also all of its component parts, i.e., the Credit-Suisse-to-Citizens-Bank and the Citizens-Bank-to-Merit transfers.  FTI maintains that the only relevant transfer is the transfer that it sought to avoid, specifically, the overarching transfer between Valley View and Merit.  Pp. 9-14.\n",
      "          (1) The language of §546(e) and the specific context in which that language is used support the conclusion that the relevant transfer for purposes of the safe-harbor inquiry is the transfer the trustee seeks to avoid.  The first clause of the provision--\"Notwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title\"--indicates that §546(e) operates as an exception to trustees' avoiding powers granted elsewhere in the Code.  The text makes clear that the starting point for the §546(e) inquiry is the expressly listed avoiding powers and, consequently, the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid in exercising those powers.  The last clause--\"except under section 548(a)(1)(A) of this title\"--also focuses on the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.  Creating an exception to the exception for §548(a)(1)(A) transfers, the text refers back to a specific type of transfer that falls within the avoiding powers, signaling that the exception applies to the overarching transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid, not any component part of that transfer.  This reading is reinforced by the §546 section heading, \"Limitations on avoiding powers,\" and is confirmed by the rest of the statutory text: The provision provides that \"the trustee may not avoid\" certain transfers, which naturally invites scrutiny of the transfers that \"the trustee . . . may avoid,\" the parallel language used in the avoiding powers provisions.  The text further provides that the transfer that is saved from avoidance is one \"that is\" (not one that involves) a securities transaction covered under §546(e).  In other words, to qualify for protection under the securities safe harbor, §546(e) provides that the otherwise avoidable transfer itself be a transfer that meets the safe-harbor criteria.  Pp. 11-13.\n",
      "          (2) The statutory structure also supports this reading of §546(e).  The Code establishes a system for avoiding transfers as well as a safe harbor from avoidance.  It is thus only logical to view the pertinent transfer under §546(e) as the same transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid pursuant to one of its avoiding powers.  In an avoidance action, the trustee must establish that the transfer it seeks to set aside meets the carefully set out criteria under the substantive avoidance provisions of the Code.  The defendant in that avoidance action is free to argue that the trustee failed to properly identify an avoidable transfer under the Code, including any available arguments concerning the role of component parts of the transfer.  If a trustee properly identifies an avoidable transfer, however, the court has no reason to examine the relevance of component parts when considering a limit to the avoiding power, where that limit is defined by reference to an otherwise avoidable transfer, as is the case with §546(e).  Pp. 13-14.\n",
      "     (b) The primary argument Merit advances that is moored in the statutory text--concerning Congress' 2006 addition of the parenthetical \"(or for the benefit of)\" to §546(e)--is unavailing.  Merit contends that Congress meant to abrogate the Eleventh Circuit decision in In re Munford, Inc., 98 F. 3d 604, which held that §546(e) was inapplicable to transfers in which a financial institution acted only as an intermediary.  However, Merit points to nothing in the text or legislative history to corroborate its argument.  A simpler explanation rooted in the text of the statute and consistent with the interpretation of §546(e) adopted here is that Congress added the \"or for the benefit of\" language that is common in other substantive avoidance provisions to the §546(e) safe harbor to ensure that the scope of the safe harbor and scope of the avoiding powers matched.  \n",
      "     That reading would not, contrary to what Merit contends, render other provisions ineffectual or superfluous.  Rather, it gives full effect to the text of §546(e).  If the transfer the trustee seeks to avoid was made \"by\" or \"to\" a covered entity, then §546(e) will bar avoidance without regard to whether the entity acted only as an intermediary.  It will also bar avoidance if the transfer was made \"for the benefit of\" that entity, even if it was not made \"by\" or \"to\" that entity.\n",
      "     Finally, Merit argues that reading the safe harbor so that its application depends on the identity of the investor and the manner in which its investment is held rather than on the general nature of the transaction is incongruous with Congress' purportedly \"prophylactic\" approach to §546(e).  But this argument is nothing more than an attack on the text of the statute, which protects only certain transactions \"made by or to (or for the benefit of)\" certain covered entities.  Pp. 14-18.\n",
      "     (c) Applying this reading of the §546(e) safe harbor to this case yields a straightforward result.  FTI sought to avoid the Valley-View-to-Merit transfer.  When determining whether the §546(e) safe harbor saves that transfer from avoidance liability, the Court must look to that overarching transfer to evaluate whether it meets the safe-harbor criteria.  Because the parties do not contend that either Valley View or Merit is a covered entity, the transfer falls outside of the §546(e) safe harbor.  Pp. 18-19.\n",

      "     Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court.\n",
      "     To maximize the funds available for, and ensure equity in, the distribution to creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding, the Bankruptcy Code gives a trustee the power to invalidate a limited category of transfers by the debtor or transfers of an interest of the debtor in property.  Those powers, referred to as \"avoiding powers,\" are not without limits, however, as the Code sets out a number of exceptions.  The operation of one such exception, the securities safe harbor, 11 U. S. C. §546(e), is at issue in this case.  Specifically, this Court is asked to determine how the safe harbor operates in the context of a transfer that was executed via one or more transactions, e.g., a transfer from A → D that was executed via B and C as intermediaries, such that the component parts of the transfer include A → B → C → D.  If a trustee seeks to avoid the A → D transfer, and the §546(e) safe harbor is invoked as a defense, the question becomes: When determining whether the §546(e) securities safe harbor saves the transfer from avoidance, should courts look to the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid (i.e., A → D) to determine whether that transfer meets the safe-harbor criteria, or should courts look also to any component parts of the overarching transfer (i.e., A → B → C → D)?  The Court concludes that the plain meaning of §546(e) dictates that the only relevant transfer for purposes of the safe harbor is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.\n",
      "I\n",
      "A\n",
      "     Because the §546(e) safe harbor operates as a limit to the general avoiding powers of a bankruptcy trustee,1 we begin with a review of those powers.  Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code affords bankruptcy trustees the authority to \"se[t] aside certain types of transfers . . . and . . . recaptur[e] the value of those avoided transfers for the benefit of the estate.\"  Tabb §6.2, p. 474.  These avoiding powers \"help implement the core principles of bankruptcy.\"  Id., §6.1, at 468.  For example, some \"deter the race of diligence of creditors to dismember the debtor before bankruptcy\" and promote \"equality of distribution.\"  Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S. 151, 162 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Tabb §6.2.  Others set aside transfers that \"unfairly or improperly deplete . . . assets or . . . dilute the claims against those assets.\"  5 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶548.01, p. 548-10 (16th ed. 2017); see also Tabb §6.2, at 475 (noting that some avoiding powers are designed \"to ensure that the debtor deals fairly with its creditors\").\n",
      "     Sections 544 through 553 of the Code outline the circumstances under which a trustee may pursue avoidance.  See, e.g., 11 U. S. C. §544(a) (setting out circumstances under which a trustee can avoid unrecorded liens and conveyances); §544(b) (detailing power to avoid based on rights that unsecured creditors have under nonbankruptcy law); §545 (setting out criteria that allow a trustee to avoid a statutory lien); §547 (detailing criteria for avoidance of so-called \"preferential transfers\").  The particular avoidance provision at issue here is §548(a), which provides that a \"trustee may avoid\" certain fraudulent transfers \"of an interest of the debtor in property.\"  §548(a)(1).  Section 548(a)(1)(A) addresses so-called \"actually\" fraudulent transfers, which are \"made . . . with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became . . . indebted.\"  Section 548(a)(1)(B) addresses \"constructively\" fraudulent transfers.  See BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, 511 U. S. 531, 535 (1994).  As relevant to this case, the statute defines constructive fraud in part as when a debtor:\n",
      "     \"(B)(i) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation; and\n",
      "     \"(ii)(I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation.  11 U. S. C. §548(a)(1).\n",
      "     If a transfer is avoided, §550 identifies the parties from whom the trustee may recover either the transferred property or the value of that property to return to the bankruptcy estate.  Section 550(a) provides, in relevant part, that \"to the extent that a transfer is avoided . . . the trustee may recover . . . the property transferred, or, if the court so orders, the value of such property\" from \"the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made,\" or from \"any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.\"  §550(a).\n",
      "B\n",
      "     The Code sets out a number of limits on the exercise of these avoiding powers.  See, e.g., §546(a) (setting statute of limitations for avoidance actions); §§546(c)-(d) (setting certain policy-based exceptions to avoiding powers); §548(a)(2) (setting limit to avoidance of \"a charitable contribution to a qualified religious or charitable entity or organization\").  Central to this case is the securities safe harbor set forth in §546(e), which provides (as presently codified and in full):\n",
      "\"Notwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title, the trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a margin payment, as defined in section 101, 741, or 761 of this title, or settlement payment, as defined in section 101 or 741 of this title, made by or to (or for the benefit of ) a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial  institution, financial participant, or securities clearing agency, or that is a transfer made by or to (or for the benefit of ) a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, financial participant, or securities clearing agency, in connection with a securities contract, as defined in section 741(7), commodity contract, as defined in section 761(4), or forward contract, that is made before the commencement of the case, except under section 548(a)(1)(A) of this title.\"\n",
      "     The predecessor to this securities safe harbor, formerly codified at 11 U. S. C. §764(c), was enacted in 1978 against the backdrop of a district court decision in a case called Seligson v. New York Produce Exchange, 394 F. Supp. 125 (SDNY 1975), which involved a transfer by a bankrupt commodity broker.  See S. Rep. No. 95-989, pp. 8, 106 (1978); see also Brubaker, Understanding the Scope of the §546(e) Securities Safe Harbor Through the Concept of the \"Transfer\" Sought To Be Avoided, 37 Bkrtcy. L. Letter 11-12 (July 2017).  The bankruptcy trustee in Seligson filed suit seeking to avoid over $12 million in margin payments made by the commodity broker debtor to a clearing association on the basis that the transfer was constructively fraudulent.  The clearing association attempted to defend on the theory that it was a mere \"conduit\" for the transmission of the margin payments.  394 F. Supp., at 135.  The District Court found, however, triable issues of fact on that question and denied summary judgment, leaving the clearing association exposed to the risk of significant liability.  See id., at 135-136.  Following that decision, Congress enacted the §764(c) safe harbor, providing that \"the trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a margin payment to or deposit with a commodity broker or forward contract merchant or is a settlement payment made by a clearing organization.\"  92 Stat. 2619, codified at 11 U. S. C. §764(c) (repealed 1982).\n",
      "     Congress amended the securities safe harbor exception over the years, each time expanding the categories of covered transfers or entities.  In 1982, Congress expanded the safe harbor to protect margin and settlement payments \"made by or to a commodity broker, forward contract merchant, stockbroker, or securities clearing agency.\"  §4, 96 Stat. 236, codified at 11 U. S. C. §546(d).  Two years later Congress added \"financial institution\" to the list of protected entities.  See §461(d), 98 Stat. 377, codified at 11 U. S. C. §546(e).2  In 2005, Congress again expanded the list of protected entities to include a \"financial participant\" (defined as an entity conducting certain high-value transactions).  See §907(b), 119 Stat. 181-182; 11 U. S. C. §101(22A).  And, in 2006, Congress amended the provision to cover transfers made in connection with securities contracts, commodity contracts, and forward contracts.  §5(b)(1), 120 Stat. 2697-2698.  The 2006 amendment also modified the statute to its current form by adding the new parenthetical phrase \"(or for the benefit of )\" after \"by or to,\" so that the safe harbor now covers transfers made \"by or to (or for the benefit of )\" one of the covered entities.  Id., at 2697.\n",

      "     With this background, we now turn to the facts of this case, which comes to this Court from the world of competitive harness racing (a form of horse racing).  Harness racing is a closely regulated industry in Pennsylvania, and the Commonwealth requires a license to operate a racetrack.  See Bedford Downs Management Corp. v. State Harness Racing Comm'n, 592 Pa. 475, 485-487, 926 A. 2d 908, 914-915 (2007) (per curiam).  The number of available licenses is limited, and in 2003 two companies, Valley View Downs, LP, and Bedford Downs Management Corporation, were in competition for the last harness-racing license in Pennsylvania.\n",
      "     Valley View and Bedford Downs needed the harness-racing license to open a \" 'racino,' \" which is a clever moniker for racetrack casino, \"a racing facility with slot machines.\"  Brief for Petitioner 8.  Both companies were stopped before the finish line, because in 2005 the Pennsylvania State Harness Racing Commission denied both applications.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld those denials in 2007, but allowed the companies to reapply for the license.  See Bedford Downs, 592 Pa., at 478-479, 926 A. 2d, at 910.\n",
      "     Instead of continuing to compete for the last available harness-racing license, Valley View and Bedford Downs entered into an agreement to resolve their ongoing feud.  Under that agreement, Bedford Downs withdrew as a competitor for the harness-racing license, and Valley View was to purchase all of Bedford Downs' stock for $55 million after Valley View obtained the license.3\n",
      "     With Bedford Downs out of the race, the Pennsylvania Harness Racing Commission awarded Valley View the last harness-racing license.  Valley View proceeded with the corporate acquisition required by the parties' agreement and arranged for the Cayman Islands branch of Credit Suisse to finance the $55 million purchase price as part of a larger $850 million transaction.  Credit Suisse wired the $55 million to Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, which had agreed to serve as the third-party escrow agent for the transaction.  The Bedford Downs shareholders, including petitioner Merit Management Group, LP, deposited their stock certificates into escrow as well.  At closing, Valley View received the Bedford Downs stock certificates, and in October 2007 Citizens Bank disbursed $47.5 million to the Bedford Downs shareholders, with $7.5 million remaining in escrow at Citizens Bank under the multiyear indemnification holdback period provided for in the parties' agreement.  Citizens Bank disbursed that $7.5 million installment to the Bedford Downs shareholders in October 2010, after the holdback period ended.  All told, Merit received approximately $16.5 million from the sale of its Bedford Downs stock to Valley View.  Notably, the closing statement for the transaction reflected Valley View as the \"Buyer,\" the Bedford Downs shareholders as the \"Sellers,\" and $55 million as the \"Purchase Price.\"  App. 30.\n",
      "     In the end, Valley View never got to open its racino.  Although it had secured the last harness-racing license, it was unable to secure a separate gaming license for the operation of the slot machines in the time set out in its financing package.  Valley View and its parent company, Centaur, LLC, thereafter filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  The Bankruptcy Court confirmed a reorganization plan and appointed respondent FTI Consulting, Inc., to serve as trustee of the Centaur litigation trust.\n",
      "     FTI filed suit against Merit in the Northern District of Illinois, seeking to avoid the $16.5 million transfer from Valley View to Merit for the sale of Bedford Downs' stock.  The complaint alleged that the transfer was constructively fraudulent under §548(a)(1)(B) of the Code because Valley View was insolvent when it purchased Bedford Downs and \"significantly overpaid\" for the Bedford Downs stock.4  Merit moved for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), contending that the §546(e) safe harbor barred FTI from avoiding the Valley View-to-Merit transfer.  According to Merit, the safe harbor applied because the transfer was a \"settlement payment . . . made by or to (or for the benefit of )\" a covered \"financial institution\"--here, Credit Suisse and Citizens Bank.\n",
      "     The District Court granted the Rule 12(c) motion, reasoning that the §546(e) safe harbor applied because the financial institutions transferred or received funds in connection with a \"settlement payment\" or \"securities contract.\"  See 541 B. R. 850, 858 (ND Ill. 2015).5  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that the §546(e) safe harbor did not protect transfers in which financial institutions served as mere conduits.  See 830 F. 3d 690, 691 (2016).  This Court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the circuit courts as to the proper application of the §546(e) safe harbor.6  581 U. S. ___ (2017).\n",
      "II\n",
      "     The question before this Court is whether the transfer between Valley View and Merit implicates the safe harbor exception because the transfer was \"made by or to (or for the benefit of ) a . . . financial institution.\"  §546(e).  The parties and the lower courts dedicate much of their attention to the definition of the words \"by or to (or for the benefit of )\" as used in §546(e), and to the question whether there is a requirement that the \"financial institution\" or other covered entity have a beneficial interest in or dominion and control over the transferred property in order to qualify for safe harbor protection.  In our view, those inquiries put the proverbial cart before the horse.  Before a court can determine whether a transfer was made by or to or for the benefit of a covered entity, the court must first identify the relevant transfer to test in that inquiry.  At bottom, that is the issue the parties dispute in this case.\n",
      "     On one side, Merit posits that the Court should look not only to the Valley View-to-Merit end-to-end transfer, but also to all its component parts.  Here, those component parts include one transaction by Credit Suisse to Citizens Bank (i.e., the transmission of the $16.5 million from Credit Suisse to escrow at Citizens Bank), and two transactions by Citizens Bank to Merit (i.e., the transmission of $16.5 million over two installments by Citizens Bank as escrow agent to Merit).  Because those component parts include transactions by and to financial institutions, Merit contends that §546(e) bars avoidance.\n",
      "     FTI, by contrast, maintains that the only relevant transfer for purposes of the §546(e) safe-harbor inquiry is the overarching transfer between Valley View and Merit of $16.5 million for purchase of the stock, which is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid under §548(a)(1)(B).  Because that transfer was not made by, to, or for the benefit of a financial institution, FTI contends that the safe harbor has no application.\n",
      "     The Court agrees with FTI.  The language of §546(e), the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader statutory structure all support the conclusion that the relevant transfer for purposes of the §546(e) safe-harbor inquiry is the overarching transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid under one of the substantive avoidance provisions.\n",
      "A\n",
      "     Our analysis begins with the text of §546(e), and we look to both \"the language itself [and] the specific context in which that language is used . . . .\"  Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997).  The pertinent language provides:\n",
      "     \"Notwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title, the trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a . . . settlement payment . . . made by or to (or for the benefit of ) a . . . financial institution . . . or that is a transfer made by or to (or for the benefit of ) a . . . financial institution . . . in connection with a securities contract . . . , except under section 548(a)(1)(A) of this title.\"\n",
      "The very first clause--\"Notwithstanding sections 544, 545, 547, 548(a)(1)(B), and 548(b) of this title\"--already begins to answer the question.  It indicates that §546(e) operates as an exception to the avoiding powers afforded to the trustee under the substantive avoidance provisions.  See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 126 (2012) (\"A dependent phrase that begins with notwithstanding indicates that the main clause that it introduces or follows derogates from the provision to which it refers\").  That is, when faced with a transfer that is otherwise avoidable, §546(e) provides a safe harbor notwithstanding that avoiding power.  From the outset, therefore, the text makes clear that the starting point for the §546(e) inquiry is the substantive avoiding power under the provisions expressly listed in the \"notwithstanding\" clause and, consequently, the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid as an exercise of those powers.\n",
      "     Then again in the very last clause--\"except under section 548(a)(1)(A) of this title\"--the text reminds us that the focus of the inquiry is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.  It does so by creating an exception to the exception, providing that \"the trustee may not avoid a transfer\" that meets the covered transaction and entity criteria of the safe harbor, \"except\" for an actually fraudulent transfer under §548(a)(1)(A).  11 U. S. C. §546(e).  By referring back to a specific type of transfer that falls within the avoiding power, Congress signaled that the exception applies to the overarching transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid, not any component part of that transfer.\n",
      "     Reinforcing that reading of the safe-harbor provision, the section heading for §546--within which the securities safe harbor is found--is: \"Limitations on avoiding powers.\"  Although section headings cannot limit the plain meaning of a statutory text, see Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. 33, 47 (2008), \"they supply cues\" as to what Congress intended, see Yates v. United States, 574 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10).  In this case, the relevant section heading demonstrates the close connection between the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid and the transfer that is exempted from that avoiding power pursuant to the safe harbor.\n",
      "     The rest of the statutory text confirms what the \"notwithstanding\" and \"except\" clauses and the section heading begin to suggest.  The safe harbor provides that \"the trustee may not avoid\" certain transfers.  §546(e).  Naturally, that text invites scrutiny of the transfers that \"the trustee may avoid,\" the parallel language used in the substantive avoiding powers provisions.  See §544(a) (providing that \"the trustee . . . may avoid\" transfers falling under that provision); §545 (providing that \"[t]he trustee may avoid\" certain statutory liens); §547(b) (providing that \"the trustee may avoid\" certain preferential transfers); §548(a)(1) (providing that \"[t]he trustee may avoid\" certain fraudulent transfers).  And if any doubt remained, the language that follows dispels that doubt: The transfer that the \"the trustee may not avoid\" is specified to be \"a transfer that is\" either a \"settlement payment\" or made \"in connection with a securities contract.\"  §546(e) (emphasis added).  Not a transfer that involves.  Not a transfer that comprises.  But a transfer that is a securities transaction covered under §546(e).  The provision explicitly equates the transfer that the trustee may otherwise avoid with the transfer that, under the safe harbor, the trustee may not avoid.  In other words, to qualify for protection under the securities safe harbor, §546(e) provides that the otherwise avoidable transfer itself be a transfer that meets the safe-harbor criteria.\n",
      "     Thus, the statutory language and the context in which it is used all point to the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid as the relevant transfer for consideration of the §546(e) safe-harbor criteria.\n",
      "B\n",
      "     The statutory structure also reinforces our reading of §546(e).  See Hall v. United States, 566 U. S. 506, 516 (2012) (looking to statutory structure in interpreting the Bankruptcy Code).  As the Seventh Circuit aptly put it, the Code \"creates both a system for avoiding transfers and a safe harbor from avoidance--logically these are two sides of the same coin.\"  830 F. 3d, at 694; see also Fidelity Financial Services, Inc. v. Fink, 522 U. S. 211, 217 (1998) (\"Section 546 of the Code puts certain limits on the avoidance powers set forth elsewhere\").  Given that structure, it is only logical to view the pertinent transfer under §546(e) as the same transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid pursuant to one of its avoiding powers.\n",
      "     As noted in Part I-A, supra, the substantive avoidance provisions in Chapter 5 of the Code set out in detail the criteria that must be met for a transfer to fall within the ambit of the avoiding powers.  These provisions, as Merit admits, \"focus mostly on the characteristics of the transfer that may be avoided.\"  Brief for Petitioner 28.  The trustee, charged with exercising those avoiding powers, must establish to the satisfaction of a court that the transfer it seeks to set aside meets the characteristics set out under the substantive avoidance provisions.  Thus, the trustee is not free to define the transfer that it seeks to avoid in any way it chooses.  Instead, that transfer is necessarily defined by the carefully set out criteria in the Code.  As FTI itself recognizes, its power as trustee to define the transfer is not absolute because \"the transfer identified must satisfy the terms of the avoidance provision the trustee invokes.\"  Brief for Respondent 23.\n",
      "     Accordingly, after a trustee files an avoidance action identifying the transfer it seeks to set aside, a defendant in that action is free to argue that the trustee failed to properly identify an avoidable transfer under the Code, including any available arguments concerning the role of component parts of the transfer.  If a trustee properly identifies an avoidable transfer, however, the court has no reason to examine the relevance of component parts when considering a limit to the avoiding power, where that limit is defined by reference to an otherwise avoidable transfer, as is the case with §546(e), see Part II-A, supra.\n",
      "     In the instant case, FTI identified the purchase of Bedford Downs' stock by Valley View from Merit as the transfer that it sought to avoid.  Merit does not contend that FTI improperly identified the Valley View-to-Merit transfer as the transfer to be avoided, focusing instead on whether FTI can \"ignore\" the component parts at the safe-harbor inquiry.  Absent that argument, however, the Credit Suisse and Citizens Bank component parts are simply irrelevant to the analysis under §546(e).  The focus must remain on the transfer the trustee sought to avoid.\n",
      "III\n",
      "A\n",
      "     The primary argument Merit advances that is moored in the statutory text concerns the 2006 addition of the parenthetical \"(or for the benefit of )\" to §546(e).  Merit contends that in adding the phrase \"or for the benefit of\" to the requirement that a transfer be \"made by or to\" a protected entity, Congress meant to abrogate the 1998 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in In re Munford, Inc., 98 F. 3d 604, 610 (1996) (per curiam), which held that the §546(e) safe harbor was inapplicable to transfers in which a financial institution acted only as an intermediary.  Congress abrogated Munford, Merit reasons, by use of the disjunctive \"or,\" so that even if a beneficial interest, i.e., a transfer \"for the benefit of\" a financial institution or other covered entity, is sufficient to trigger safe harbor protection, it is not necessary for the financial institution to have a beneficial interest in the transfer for the safe harbor to apply.  Merit thus argues that a transaction \"by or to\" a financial institution such as Credit Suisse or Citizens Bank would meet the requirements of §546(e), even if the financial institution is acting as an intermediary without a beneficial interest in the transfer.\n",
      "     Merit points to nothing in the text or legislative history that corroborates the proposition that Congress sought to overrule Munford in its 2006 amendment.  There is a simpler explanation for Congress' addition of this language that is rooted in the text of the statute as a whole and consistent with the interpretation of §546(e) the Court adopts.  A number of the substantive avoidance provisions include that language, thus giving a trustee the power to avoid a transfer that was made to \"or for the benefit of\" certain actors.  See §547(b)(1) (avoiding power with respect to preferential transfers \"to or for the benefit of a creditor\"); §548(a)(1) (avoiding power with respect to certain fraudulent transfers \"including any transfer to or for the benefit of an insider . . . \").  By adding the same language to the §546(e) safe harbor, Congress ensured that the scope of the safe harbor matched the scope of the avoiding powers.  For example, a trustee seeking to avoid a preferential transfer under §547 that was made \"for the benefit of a creditor,\" where that creditor is a covered entity under §546(e), cannot now escape application of the §546(e) safe harbor just because the transfer was not \"made by or to\" that entity.\n",
      "     Nothing in the amendment therefore changed the focus of the §546(e) safe-harbor inquiry on the transfer that is otherwise avoidable under the substantive avoiding powers.  If anything, by tracking language already included in the substantive avoidance provisions, the amendment reinforces the connection between the inquiry under §546(e) and the otherwise avoidable transfer that the trustee seeks to set aside.\n",
      "     Merit next attempts to bolster its reading of the safe harbor by reference to the inclusion of securities clearing agencies as covered entities under §546(e).  Because a securities clearing agency is defined as, inter alia, an intermediary in payments or deliveries made in connection with securities transactions, see 15 U. S. C. §78c(23)(A) and 11 U. S. C. §101(48) (defining \"securities clearing agency\" by reference to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), Merit argues that the §546(e) safe harbor must be read to protect intermediaries without reference to any beneficial interest in the transfer.  The contrary interpretation, Merit contends, \"would run afoul of the canon disfavoring an interpretation of a statute that renders a provision ineffectual or superfluous.\"  Brief for Petitioner 25.\n",
      "     Putting aside the question whether a securities clearing agency always acts as an intermediary without a beneficial interest in a challenged transfer--a question that the District Court in Seligson found presented triable issues of fact in that case--the reading of the statute the Court adopts here does not yield any superfluity.  Reading §546(e) to provide that the relevant transfer for purposes of the safe harbor is the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid under a substantive avoiding power, the question then becomes whether that transfer was \"made by or to (or for the benefit of )\" a covered entity, including a securities clearing agency.  If the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid was made \"by\" or \"to\" a securities clearing agency (as it was in Seligson), then §546(e) will bar avoidance, and it will do so without regard to whether the entity acted only as an intermediary.  The safe harbor will, in addition, bar avoidance if the transfer was made \"for the benefit of\" that securities clearing agency, even if it was not made \"by\" or \"to\" that entity.  This reading gives full effect to the text of §546(e).\n",
      "B\n",
      "     In a final attempt to support its proposed interpretation of §546(e), Merit turns to what it perceives was Congress' purpose in enacting the safe harbor.  Specifically, Merit contends that the broad language of §546(e) shows that Congress took a \"comprehensive approach to securities and commodities transactions\" that \"was prophylactic, not surgical,\" and meant to \"advanc[e] the interests of parties in the finality of transactions.\"  Brief for Petitioner 41-43.  Given that purported broad purpose, it would be incongruous, according to Merit, to read the safe harbor such that its application \"would depend on the identity of the investor and the manner in which it held its investment\" rather than \"the nature of the transaction generally.\"  Id., at 33.  Moreover, Merit posits that Congress' concern was plainly broader than the risk that is posed by the imposition of avoidance liability on a securities industry entity because Congress provided a safe harbor not only for transactions \"to\" those entities (thus protecting the entities from direct financial liability), but also \"by\" these entities to non-covered entities.  See Reply Brief 10-14.  And, according to Merit, \"[t]here is no reason to believe that Congress was troubled by the possibility that transfers by an industry hub could be unwound but yet was unconcerned about trustees' pursuit of transfers made through industry hubs.\"  Id., at 12-13 (emphasis in original).\n",
      "     Even if this were the type of case in which the Court would consider statutory purpose, see, e.g., Watson v. Philip Morris Cos., 551 U. S. 142, 150-152 (2007), here Merit fails to support its purposivist arguments.  In fact, its perceived purpose is actually contradicted by the plain language of the safe harbor.  Because, of course, here we do have a good reason to believe that Congress was concerned about transfers \"by an industry hub\" specifically: The safe harbor saves from avoidance certain securities transactions \"made by or to (or for the benefit of )\" covered entities.  See §546(e).  Transfers \"through\" a covered entity, conversely, appear nowhere in the statute.  And although Merit complains that, absent its reading of the safe harbor, protection will turn \"on the identity of the investor and the manner in which it held its investment,\" that is nothing more than an attack on the text of the statute, which protects only certain transactions \"made by or to (or for the benefit of )\" certain covered entities.\n",
      "     For these reasons, we need not deviate from the plain meaning of the language used in §546(e).\n",
      "IV\n",
      "     For the reasons stated, we conclude that the relevant transfer for purposes of the §546(e) safe harbor is the same transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid pursuant to its substantive avoiding powers.  Applying that understanding of the safe-harbor provision to this case yields a straightforward result.  FTI, the trustee, sought to avoid the $16.5 million Valley View-to-Merit transfer.  FTI did not seek to avoid the component transactions by which that overarching transfer was executed.  As such, when determining whether the §546(e) safe harbor saves the transfer from avoidance liability, i.e., whether it was \"made by or to (or for the benefit of ) a . . . financial institution,\" the Court must look to the overarching transfer from Valley View to Merit to evaluate whether it meets the safe-harbor criteria.  Because the parties do not contend that either Valley View or Merit is a \"financial institution\" or other covered entity, the transfer falls outside of the §546(e) safe harbor.  The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is therefore affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n",
      "It is so ordered.\n",
      "\n",

See Brief for Petitioner 45, n. 14; Reply Brief 14, n. 6.  We therefore do not address what impact, if any, §101(22)(A) would have in the application of the §546(e) safe harbor.\n",

      "Petitioner Charles Murphy was awarded a judgment in his federal civil rights suit against two of his prison guards, including an award of attorney's fees.  Pursuant to 42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(2), which provides that in such cases \"a portion of the [prisoner's] judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant,\" the district court ordered Mr. Murphy to pay 10% of his judgment toward the fee award, leaving defendants responsible for the remainder.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that §1997e(d)(2) required the district court to exhaust 25% of the prisoner's judgment before demanding payment from the defendants.\n",
      "Held: In cases governed by §1997e(d), district courts must apply as much of the judgment as necessary, up to 25%, to satisfy an award of attorney's fees.  The specific statutory language supports the Seventh Circuit's interpretation.  First, the mandatory phrase \"shall be applied\" suggests that the district court has some nondiscretionary duty to perform.  Second, the infinitival phrase \"to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded\" specifies the purpose or aim of the preceding verb's nondiscretionary duty.  Third, \"to satisfy\" an obligation, especially a financial obligation, usually means to discharge the obligation in full.  Together, these three clues suggest that a district court (1) must act (2) with the purpose of (3) fully discharging the fee award.  And the district court must use as much of the judgment as necessary to satisfy the fee award without exceeding the 25% cap.  Contrary to Mr. Murphy's suggestion, the district court does not have wide discretion to pick any \"portion\" that does not exceed the 25% cap.  The larger statutory scheme supports the Seventh Circuit's interpretation.  The previously governing provision, 42 U. S. C. §1988(b), granted district courts discretion to award fees in unambiguous terms.  It is doubtful that Congress, had it wished to confer the same sort of discretion in §1997e(d), would have bothered to write a new law for prisoner civil rights suits alone; omit all of the words that afforded discretion in the old law; and then replace those old discretionary words with new mandatory ones.  This conclusion is reinforced by §1997e(d)'s surrounding provisions, which like paragraph (2), also limit the district court's pre-existing discretion under §1988(b).  See, e.g., §§1997e(d)(1)(A) and (B)(ii).  The discretion urged by Mr. Murphy is exactly the sort of unguided and freewheeling choice that this Court has sought to expunge from practice under §1988.  And his suggested cure for rudderless discretion--to have district courts apportion fees in proportion to the defendant's culpability--has no basis in the statutory text or roots in the law.

      "     Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the Court.\n",
      "     This is a case about how much prevailing prisoners must pay their lawyers.  When a prisoner wins a civil rights suit and the district court awards fees to the prisoner's attorney, a federal statute says that \"a portion of the [prisoner's] judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant.  If the award of attorney's fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.\"  42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(2).  Whatever else you might make of this, the first sentence pretty clearly tells us that the prisoner has to pay some part of the attorney's fee award before financial responsibility shifts to the defendant.  But how much is enough?  Does the first sentence allow the district court discretion to take any amount it wishes from the plaintiff's judgment to pay the attorney, from 25% down to a penny?  Or does the first sentence instead mean that the court must pay the attorney's entire fee award from the plaintiff's judgment until it reaches the 25% cap and only then turn to the defendant?\n",
      "     The facts of our case illustrate the problem we face.  After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for Charles Murphy in the amount of $307,733.82 against two of his prison guards, Officer Robert Smith and Lieutenant Gregory Fulk.  The court also awarded Mr. Murphy's attorney $108,446.54 in fees.  So far, so good.  But then came the question who should pay what portion of the fee award.  The defendants argued that, under the statute's terms, the court had to take 25% (or about $77,000) from Mr. Murphy's judgment before taxing them for the balance of the fee award.  The court, however, refused that request.  Instead, it ordered that Mr. Murphy \"shall pay 10% of [his] judgment\" (or about $31,000) toward the fee award, with the defendants responsible for the rest.  In support of this allocation, the district court explained that it commonly varied the amount prisoners pay, though the court offered no explanation for choosing 10% instead of some other number.  On appeal, a unanimous panel reversed, explaining its view that the language of §1997e(d)(2) requires a district court to exhaust 25% of the prisoner's judgment before demanding payment from the defendants.  844 F. 3d 653, 660 (CA7 2016).  So there we have both sides of the debate, and our question, in a nutshell: did the district court have latitude to apply 10% (or some other discretionary amount) of the plaintiff's judgment to his attorney's fee award instead of 25%?  See 582 U. S. ___ (2017) (granting certiorari to resolve this question).\n",
      "     As always, we start with the specific statutory language in dispute.  That language (again) says \"a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded.\"  §1997e(d)(2).  And we think this much tells us a few things.  First, the word \"shall\" usually creates a mandate, not a liberty, so the verb phrase \"shall be applied\" tells us that the district court has some nondiscretionary duty to perform.  See Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 35 (1998) (\"[T]he mandatory 'shall' . . . normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion\").  Second, immediately following the verb we find an infinitival phrase (\"to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded\") that specifies the purpose or aim of the verb's non-discretionary duty.  Cf. R. Huddleston & G. Pullum, Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, ch. 8, §§1, 12.2, pp. 669, 729-730 (2002).  Third, we know that when you purposefully seek or aim \"to satisfy\" an obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually means you intend to discharge the obligation in full.1  Together, then, these three clues suggest that the court (1) must apply judgment funds toward the fee award (2) with the purpose of (3) fully discharging the fee award.  And to meet that duty, a district court must apply as much of the judgment as necessary to satisfy the fee award, without of course exceeding the 25% cap.  If Congress had wished to afford the judge more discretion in this area, it could have easily substituted \"may\" for \"shall.\"  And if Congress had wished to prescribe a different purpose for the judge to pursue, it could have easily replaced the infinitival phrase \"to satisfy . . . \" with \"to reduce . . . \" or \"against . . . .\"  But Congress didn't choose those other words.  And respect for Congress's prerogatives as policymaker means carefully attending to the words it chose rather than replacing them with others of our own.\n",
      "     Mr. Murphy's reply does more to hurt than help his cause.  Consider, he says, college math credits that the college prospectus says shall be \"applied to satisfy\" a chemistry degree.  No one, the argument goes, would understand that phrase to suggest a single math course will fully discharge all chemistry degree requirements.  We quite agree, but that is beside the point.  In Mr. Murphy's example, as in our statute, the word \"satisfy\" does not suggest some hidden empirical judgment about how often a math class will satisfy a chemistry degree.  Instead it serves to tell the college registrar what purpose he must pursue when handed the student's transcript: the registrar must, without discretion, apply those credits toward the satisfaction or discharge of the student's credit obligations.  No doubt a college student needing three credits to graduate who took a three-credit math course would be bewildered to learn the registrar thought he had discretion to count only two of those credits toward her degree.  So too here.  It doesn't matter how many fee awards will be fully satisfied from a judgment without breaking the 25% cap, or whether any particular fee award could be.  The statute's point is to instruct the judge about the purpose he must pursue--to discharge the fee award using judgment funds to the extent possible, subject to the 25% cap.\n",
      "     Retreating now, Mr. Murphy contends that whatever the verb and the infinitival phrase mean, the subject of the sentence--\"a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent)\"--necessarily suggests wide judicial discretion.  This language, he observes, anticipates a range of amounts (some \"portion\" up to 25%) that can be taken from his judgment.  And the existence of the range, Mr. Murphy contends, necessarily means that the district court must enjoy discretion to pick any \"portion\" so long as it doesn't exceed the 25% cap.      \n",
      "     But that does not logically follow.  Under either side's reading of the statute the portion of fees taken from the plaintiff's judgment will vary over a range--whether because of the district court's discretionary choice (as Mr. Murphy contends), or because of the variance in the size of fee awards themselves, which sometimes will be less than 25% of the judgment (as Officer Smith and Lieutenant Fulk suggest).  If the police have two suspects in a robbery committed with a red getaway car, the fact that one suspect drives a red sedan proves nothing if the other does too.  The fact that the statute contemplates a range of possible \"portion[s]\" to be paid out of the judgment, thus, just doesn't help identify which of the two proposed interpretations we should adopt for both bear that feature.\n",
      "     Nor does the word \"portion\" necessarily denote unfettered discretion.  If someone told you to follow a written recipe but double the portion of sugar, you would know precisely how much sugar to put in--twice whatever's on the page.  And Congress has certainly used the word \"portion\" in just that way.  Take 16 U. S. C. §673b, which defines the National Elk Refuge to include the \"[e]ntire portion now in Jackson Hole National Monument except that portion in section 2 lying west of the east right-of-way line of United States Highway Numbered 187,\" among other similar plots--descriptions sufficiently determinate that the statute itself can later give the total number of acres of covered land (\"six thousand three hundred and seventy-six acres, more or less\").  So the question is how has Congress used the word \"portion\" in this statute?  And as we have explained, the text persuades us that, subject to the 25% cap, the size of the relevant \"portion\" here is fixed by reference to the size of the attorney's fee award, not left to a district court's unguided choice.\n",
      "     Even if the interpretive race in this case seems close at this point, close races still have winners.  Besides, stepping back to take in the larger statutory scheme surrounding the specific language before us reveals that this case isn't quite as close as it might first appear.  In 1976, Congress enacted what is now 42 U. S. C. §1988(b) to authorize discretionary fee shifting in civil rights suits.  Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act, 90 Stat. 2641.  For years that statute governed the award of attorney's fees in a large variety of civil rights actions, including prisoner civil rights lawsuits like this one.  But in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Congress reentered the field and adopted §1997e's new and specialized fee shifting rule for prisoner civil rights suits alone.  See 110 Stat. 1321-71.\n",
      "     Comparing the terms of the old and new statutes helps to shed a good deal of light on the parties' positions.  Section 1988(b) confers discretion on district courts in unambiguous terms: \"[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs\" against the defendant. (Emphasis added.)  Meanwhile, §1997e(d) expressly qualifies the usual operation of §1988(b) in prisoner cases.  See §1997e(d)(1) (providing that \"[i]n any action brought by a prisoner . . . in which attorney's fees are authorized under section 1988 . . . such fees shall not be awarded, except\" under certain conditions).  And as we've seen §1997e(d)(2) proceeds to use very different language to describe the district court's job in awarding fees.  It does not say \"may,\" it does not say \"reasonable,\" and it certainly does not say anything about \"discretion.\"  If Congress had wished to confer the same discretion in §1997e(d) that it conferred in §1988(b), we very much doubt it would have bothered to write a new law; omit all the words that afforded discretion in the old law; and then replace those old discretionary words with new mandatory ones.  See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (refusing to conclude that \"the differing language\" in two statutory provisions \"has the same meaning in each\").\n",
      "     The surrounding statutory structure of §1997e(d) reinforces this conclusion.  Like paragraph (2), the other provisions of §1997e(d) also limit the district court's pre-existing discretion under §1988(b).  These provisions limit the fees that would otherwise be available under §1988 to cover only certain kinds of lawyerly tasks, see §§1997e(d)(1)(A) and (B)(ii); they require proportionality between fee awards and the relief ordered, see §1997e(d)(1)(B)(i); and they restrict the hourly rate of the prisoner's lawyer, see §1997e(d)(3).  All this suggests a statute that seeks to restrain, rather than replicate, the discretion found in §1988(b).\n",
      "     Notably, too, the discretion Mr. Murphy would have us introduce into §1997e doesn't even sit easily with our precedent under §1988. Our cases interpreting §1988 establish \"[a] strong presumption that the lodestar figure--the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate--represents a 'reasonable' fee.\"  Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565 (1986).  To be sure, before the lodestar became \"the guiding light of our fee shifting jurisprudence,\" Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562 (1992), many lower courts used one of your classic 12-factor balancing tests.  See Delaware Valley, 478 U. S., at 562, and n. 7.  Ultimately, though, this Court rejected undue reliance on the 12-factor test because it \"gave very little actual guidance to district courts[,] . . . placed unlimited discretion in trial judges[,] and produced disparate results.\"  Id., at 563.  Yet, despite this guidance, Mr. Murphy effectively seeks to (re)introduce into §1997e(d)(2) exactly the sort of unguided and freewheeling choice--and the disparate results that come with it--that this Court has sought to expunge from practice under §1988.  And he seeks to achieve all this on the basis of considerably less helpful statutory language.  To state the suggestion is to reveal its defect.\n",
      "     Nor does Mr. Murphy's proposed cure solve his problem.  To avoid reading §1997e(d)(2) as affording entirely rudderless discretion, Mr. Murphy contends that district courts should apportion fees in proportion to the defendant's culpability.  When a defendant has acted egregiously, he says, the court should lower the plaintiff's responsibility for the fee award and increase the defendant's--even if that means applying only a \"nominal\" amount of the plaintiff's judgment toward the fee.  But precisely none of this appears in §1997e(d)(2) or, for that matter, enjoys any analogue in §1988's lodestar analysis or even the old 12-factor approach.  Whatever you might have to say about Mr. Murphy's culpability formula as a matter of policy, it has no roots in the law.  Nor is it clear, for what it's worth, that the culpability approach would even help him.  The district court never cited the defendants' culpability (or any other reason) to justify taking only 10% rather than 25% from Mr. Murphy's judgment.  And it's tough to see what the choice of 10% might have had to do with the defendant's culpability in this case.  The district court actually remitted the jury's punitive damages award-- suggesting that, if anything, the defendants' culpability had been already amply addressed.\n",
      "     At the end of the day, what may have begun as a close race turns out to have a clear winner.  Now with a view of the full field of textual, contextual, and precedential evidence, we think the interpretation the court of appeals adopted prevails.  In cases governed by §1997e(d), we hold that district courts must apply as much of the judgment as necessary, up to 25%, to satisfy an award of attorney's fees.2\n",

      "     The Court concludes that the attorney's fee apportionment provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), 42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(2), requires that a district court endeavor to fulfill the entirety of an attorney's fee award from the monetary judgment awarded to a prevailing prisoner-plaintiff, and only if 25 percent of the judgment is inadequate to cover the fee award can the court require contribution from the defendant.  Ante, at 8.  I cannot agree.  The text of §1997e(d)(2)--\"a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant\"--and its statutory context make clear that the provision permits district courts to exercise discretion in choosing the portion of a prisoner-plaintiff's monetary judgment that must be applied toward an attorney's fee award, so long as that portion is not greater than 25 percent.  I therefore respectfully dissent.\n",
      "I\n",
      "     In approaching this case, it helps to understand the background of the fee award at issue.  On July 25, 2011, petitioner Charles Murphy, a prisoner at the Vandalia Correctional Center in Illinois, reported that his assigned seat at mealtime had food and water on it, which resulted in Murphy being handcuffed and escorted to a segregation building.  Once there, Murphy taunted respondent Correctional Officer Robert Smith, who responded by hitting Murphy in the eye and applying a choke hold, causing Murphy to lose consciousness.  When Murphy woke up, Officer Smith and respondent Lieutenant Gregory Fulk were pushing him into a cell.  His hands were still cuffed behind his back and he fell face-first into the cell and hit his head on a metal toilet.  Officer Smith and Lieutenant Fulk then stripped Murphy of his clothes, removed his handcuffs, and left him in the cell without checking his condition.  Thirty or forty minutes passed until a nurse arrived to attend to Murphy, who was sent to a hospital.  Part of his eye socket had been crushed and required surgery.  Despite the procedure, Murphy did not fully recover; almost five years later, his vision remained doubled and blurred.\n",
      "     Murphy sued respondents under 42 U. S. C. §1983 and state-law causes of action.  After trial, a jury found Officer Smith liable for state-law battery and unconstitutional use of force under the Eighth Amendment, and found Lieutenant Fulk liable for deliberate indifference to a serious medical need in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  The jury awarded Murphy $409,750.00 in compensatory and punitive damages, which the District Court reduced to $307,733.82.  The District Court also awarded Murphy's attorney $108,446.54 in fees for the several hundred hours he spent on the case and, pursuant to §1997e(d)(2), ordered Murphy to contribute 10 percent of his money judgment toward the attorney's fee award and respondents to pay the rest.\n",
      "     Respondents appealed, arguing that §1997e(d)(2) required Murphy to contribute 25 percent of his judgment toward payment of the attorney's fee award.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed and reversed.  In so doing, it acknowledged that its interpretation of §1997e(d)(2) was at odds with that of all the other Courts of Appeals to have considered the question.  See 844 F. 3d 653, 660 (2016) (citing Boesing v. Spiess, 540 F. 3d 886, 892 (CA8 2008); Parker v. Conway, 581 F. 3d 198, 205 (CA3 2009)).\n",
      "II\n",
      "A\n",
      "     The relevant provision in the PLRA provides:\n",
      "\"Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in [a civil-rights action brought by a prisoner], a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant.  If the award of attorney's fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.\"  42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(2).\n",
      "     The crux of the majority's reasoning is its definition of the infinitive \"to satisfy.\"  The majority contends that \"when you purposefully seek or aim 'to satisfy' an obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually means you intend to discharge the obligation in full.\"  Ante, at 3.  To meet its duty to act with the purpose of fully discharging the fee award, the majority reasons, \"a district court must apply as much of the judgment as necessary to satisfy the fee award, without of course exceeding the 25% cap.\"  Ibid.\n",
      "     But the phrase \"to satisfy\" as it is used in §1997e(d)(2) does not bear the weight the majority places on it.  Its neighboring text and the realities of prisoner-civil-rights litigation rebut the conclusion that \"to satisfy\" compels a district court always to maximize the amount of the prisoner-plaintiff's judgment to be contributed to the fee award, and instead indicate that the only work \"to satisfy\" does in the statute is to direct a district court to contribute some amount of the judgment toward payment of the fee award.\n",
      "     Beginning with the neighboring text, it may well be that, standing alone, \"to satisfy\" is often used to mean \"to completely fulfill an obligation.\"  But the statutory provision here does not simply say \"to satisfy\"; it says \"applied to satisfy.\"  As a matter of everyday usage, the phrase \"applied to satisfy\" often means \"applied toward the satisfaction of,\" rather than \"applied in complete fulfillment of.\"  Thus, whereas an action undertaken \"to satisfy\" an obligation might, as the majority suggests, naturally be understood as an effort to discharge the obligation in full, ante, at 3, a contribution that is \"applied to satisfy\" an obligation need not be intended to discharge the obligation in full.\n",
      "     Take a few examples: A consumer makes a payment on her credit card, which her agreement with the card company provides shall be \"applied to satisfy\" her debt.  A student enrolls in a particular type of math class, the credits from which her university registrar earlier announced shall be \"applied to satisfy\" the requirements of a physics degree.  And a law firm associate contributes hours to a pro bono matter that her firm has provided may be \"applied to satisfy\" the firm's overall billable-hours requirement.  In each case, pursuant to the relevant agreement, the payment, credits, and hours are applied toward the satisfaction of a larger obligation, but the inference is not that the consumer, student, or associate had to contribute or even necessarily did contribute the maximum possible credit card payment, classroom credits, or hours toward the fulfillment of those obligations.  The consumer may have chosen to make the minimum credit card payment because she preferred to allocate her other funds elsewhere; the student may have chosen the four-credit version of the math course over the six-credit one because the former had a better instructor; and the associate may have been judicious about the hours she dedicated to the pro bono matter because she knew her firm more highly valued paid over pro bono work.  So, too, here.  Section 1997e(d)(2), like the credit card agreement, university registrar announcement, and law firm policy, sets out the relevant rule--\"a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy\" the fee award--and the district court, like the consumer, student, and law firm associate, decides how much of the judgment to apply.\n",
      "     As a practical matter, moreover, a district court will almost never be able to discharge fully a fee award from 25 percent of a prisoner-plaintiff's judgment.  In the vast majority of prisoner-civil-rights cases, the attorney's fee award exceeds the monetary judgment awarded to the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff.  In fiscal year 2012, for instance, the median damages award in a prisoner-civil-rights action litigated to victory (i.e., not settled or decided against the prisoner) was a mere $4,185.  See Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Enters Adulthood, 5 U. C. Irvine L. Rev. 153, 168 (2015) (Table 7) (Trends in Prisoner Litigation).  Therefore, in 2012, the maximum amount (25 percent) of the median judgment that could be applied toward an attorney's fee award was $1,046.25.  The PLRA caps the hourly rate that may be awarded to a prisoner-plaintiff's attorney at 150 percent of the rate for court-appointed counsel under 18 U. S. C. §3006A, which in 2012 was $125.  42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(3); App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a. Thus, a prisoner's attorney was entitled to up to $187.50 per hour worked.  Even if a district court were to apply an hourly rate of just $100, well below the cap, unless the attorney put in fewer than 10.5 hours in the ordinary case--a virtually unimaginable scenario--25 percent of the judgment will not come close to discharging fully the attorney's fee award.1\n",
      "     Such low judgments are not a new phenomenon in prisoner-civil-rights suits; they were the norm even before Congress enacted the PLRA.  In fiscal year 1993, for example, the median damages award for prisoner-plaintiffs in cases won at trial was $1,000.  See Trends in Prisoner Litigation 167; Schlanger, Inmate Litigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1602-1603, and Table II.C (2003).2\n",
      "     Given the very small judgment awards in successfully litigated prisoner-civil-rights cases, it is hard to believe, as the majority contends, that Congress used \"applied to satisfy\" to command an effort by district courts to \"discharge . . . in full,\" ante, at 3, when in most cases, full discharge will never be possible.3  Rather, taking into account both the realities of prisoner-civil-rights litigation and the most natural reading of \"applied to satisfy,\" the more logical inference is that §1997e(d)(2) simply requires that a portion of the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff's judgment be applied toward the satisfaction of the attorney's fee award.4  It does not, however, demand that the district court always order the prisoner-plaintiff to pay the maximum possible portion of the judgment (up to 25 percent) needed to discharge fully the fee award.  Under that interpretation, applying any amount of Murphy's judgment toward payment of his attorney's fee award complies with §1997e(d)(2), whether that amount is 10 percent of the judgment as ordered by the District Court or 25 percent as ordered by the Court of Appeals.\n",
      "B\n",
      "     The majority suggests that if Congress had wanted to permit judges to pursue something other than full discharge of the fee award from the judgment, it could have replaced \"to satisfy\" with \"to reduce\" or \"against.\"  Ante, at 3.  But the majority ignores that Congress also easily could have written §1997e(d)(2) to more clearly express the meaning it and respondents champion.  The statute, for example, simply could have said: \"Twenty-five percent of the plaintiff's judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant.  If the award of attorney's fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.\"\n",
      "     In fact, Congress considered and rejected language prior to enacting the current attorney's fee apportionment provision that would have done just what the majority claims.  An earlier version of §1997e(d)(2) provided:\n",
      "\"Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action described in paragraph (1), a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant.  If the award of attorney's fees is greater than 25 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.\"  Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, S. 1279, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., §3(d), p. 16 (1995) (emphasis added).\n",
      "     The italicized clause plainly expressed what the majority contends the current provision means, i.e., that a defendant's liability for the attorney's fee award begins only if any portion of the award remains unpaid after the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff has contributed 25 percent of the judgment.  But Congress removed this clause before finalizing the bill, thus electing to keep the 25-percent ceiling for the prisoner-plaintiff's contribution to the fee award and rejecting a 25-percent floor for the defendant's contribution.  See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-378, p. 71 (1995).\n",
      "     The majority alternatively disclaims the ability to discern what motivated the deletion and pronounces that \"[i]t shows that, at some stage of the bill's consideration, its proponents likely shared [the majority's] understanding\" of how the first sentence works.  Ante, at 8-9, n. 2.  In the majority's view, it is more likely that Congress drafted two redundant sentences than two conflicting ones.  Ibid.  That supposition, however, is purely speculative.  Here is what is known for certain: Congress had before it language that would have accomplished exactly the statutory function the majority today endorses and Congress chose to excise that language from the text.  Our precedent instructs that \"[w]here Congress includes limiting language in an earlier version of a bill but deletes it prior to enactment, it may be presumed that the limitation was not intended.\"  Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23-24 (1983).  See also INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 442-443 (1987) (\" 'Few principles of statutory construction are more compelling than the proposition that Congress does not intend sub silentio to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language' \").\n",
      "C\n",
      "     The rest of the statutory text confirms that district courts have discretion to choose the amount of the judgment that must be applied toward the attorney's fee award.  Specifically, that grant of discretion is evident from Congress' use of two discretion-conferring terms, \"portion\" and \"not to exceed.\"\n",
      "     The first word, \"portion,\" is defined as \"[a] share or allotted part (as of an estate).\"  Black's Law Dictionary 1182 (7th ed. 1999).  \"Portion\" thus inherently conveys an indeterminate amount.  Take, for instance, the following sentence: \"My dinner guest has requested a portion of apple pie for dessert.\"  How much is a \"portion\" of pie?  For a marathon runner, a \"portion\" might mean a hearty serving, perhaps an eighth of a whole pie; for someone on a diet, however, a \"portion\" might mean a tiny sliver.  The dinner host can figure it out based on the circumstances.  Similarly, in this context, referencing a \"portion\" of the judgment tells us that some amount of the judgment up to 25 percent of the whole is to be applied to the attorney's fee award, but not exactly what amount.  That decision is left to the sound discretion of the district court, depending again on the circumstances.\n",
      "     The majority dismisses as insignificant Congress' use of this discretion-conferring term, arguing that under either side's reading of the statute, the \"portion\" of fees taken from the prisoner-plaintiff's judgment will vary.  See ante, at 5.  True enough,5 but that fact does not justify the majority's brushoff.  Congress' deliberate choice to use the indeterminate, discretion-conferring term \"portion\" in §1997e(d)(2) reveals much about the statute's meaning.\n",
      "     To illustrate the significance of Congress' use of the word \"portion,\" imagine that §1997e(d)(2) contained no qualifying \"not to exceed\" parenthetical, and instead provided only that \"a portion of the judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant.\"  As applied to the typical scenario, i.e., where the attorney's fee award exceeds the prisoner-plaintiff's money judgment, the most natural reading of the statute absent the limiting parenthetical is that the amount of the judgment applied to the fee award must be more than zero and less than 100 percent.  That is because, as explained above, \"portion\" means something less than the whole but does not have a fixed value.6  If the majority were correct in its reading of \"to satisfy,\" however--that it requires the district court to endeavor to discharge fully the attorney's fee award from the prisoner-plaintiff's judgment before turning to the defendant for a contribution--then, in the typical case, absent the parenthetical, we would have to conclude that \"a portion of the judgment\" always means \"all of the judgment\" or perhaps \"all of the judgment save a nominal amount.\"  I do not think it reasonable to conclude that Congress intended to ascribe such a strained meaning to \"portion.\"  That the majority's reading of one term--\"to satisfy\"--forces an implausible reading of another term--\"portion\"--strongly suggests that its reading is incorrect.\n",
      "     Congress' use of the word \"portion,\" therefore, does not merely instruct that there are a range of possible portions that can be paid out of the judgment.  \"Portion\" makes evident that the district court is afforded the discretion to choose the amount of the judgment to be paid toward the fee award.  The addition of the \"not to exceed 25 percent\" parenthetical only enhances this conclusion.  The phrase \"not to exceed,\" which is itself discretion conferring, sets an upper, but not a lower, limit and thus cabins, but does not eliminate, the exercise of discretion that \"portion\" confers.\n",
      "D\n",
      "     The distinction between cabining and eliminating discretion is also key to understanding the relationship between §1997e(d) and 42 U. S. C. §1988(b), as well as between §1997e(d)(2) and its surrounding statutory provisions.\n",
      "     Section 1988(b), the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, authorizes a district court to award \"a reasonable attorney's fee\" to a prevailing party in an action to enforce one or more of several federal civil rights laws.  Section 1997e(d) in turn imposes limits on the attorney's fees available under §1988(b) when the prevailing plaintiff in one of the specified civil-rights actions is a prisoner.  In particular, the district court may award attorney's fees to the prisoner only if \"the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff's rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under section 1988,\" and \"the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation\" or \"the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.\"  §1997e(d)(1).  In addition, as noted supra, at 5, the district court may not base an award of attorney's fees \"on an hourly rate greater than 150 percent of the hourly rate established under [18 U. S. C. §3006A] for payment of court-appointed counsel\" and, if the prisoner-plaintiff was awarded damages, may not award attorney's fees in excess of 150 percent of the monetary judgment.  §§1997e(d)(2)-(3).\n",
      "     These provisions, of course, do not eliminate a district court's discretion when it comes to the award of attorney's fees to a prevailing prisoner-plaintiff; they merely compress the range of permissible options.  A district court still has the discretion to decide whether to award attorney's fees, just as it ordinarily would under §1988(b); it simply must first ensure that the threshold conditions set out in §1997e(d)(1) are satisfied.  A district court likewise still has the discretion to determine what constitutes a reasonable amount of fees to award; it simply must abide by the two 150-percent caps in doing so.\n",
      "     Just as these surrounding statutory provisions in §1997e(d) set outward bounds on a district court's exercise of discretion while still preserving the exercise of discretion within those bounds, so, too, does §1997e(d)(2).  A district court is not free to require the defendant to pay the entire attorney's fee award, nor is it free to require the prisoner-plaintiff to give up more than 25 percent of his judgment to pay the fee award.  But within those boundaries, the district court is free to decide which party should pay what portion of the fee award.\n",
      "     The majority suggests that affording discretion to district courts when it comes to the apportionment of attorney's fee awards is in tension with our adoption of the lodestar method as the presumptive means of calculating a reasonable fee award under §1988.  Ante, at 7.  Prior to the lodestar's development, several lower courts utilized 12 \"sometimes subjective factors.\"  Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 563 (1986).  Because that method \"placed unlimited discretion in trial judges and produced disparate results,\" ibid., this Court endorsed the lodestar approach, pursuant to which a court multiplies \"the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate,\" Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 888 (1984), and then considers whether to make adjustments to that amount, see id., at 898-901; Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983).  The majority asserts that adopting Murphy's reading of §1997e(d)(2) would lead to \"exactly the sort of unguided and freewheeling choice\" this Court sought to leave behind when it sanctioned the lodestar approach.  Ante, at 7.  That analogy, however, is inapt.\n",
      "     First, the question before us is whether §1997e(d)(2) affords district courts any discretion in the apportionment of responsibility for payment of an attorney's fee award, not how district courts reasonably should exercise that discretion.  When this Court embraced the lodestar approach, it did so to provide guideposts to district courts as they exercised the discretion granted to them by §1988(b) to \"allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee.\"  By no means did this Court eliminate that exercise of discretion.  Rather, the Court has \"reemphasize[d] that the district court has discretion in determining the amount of a fee award.\"  Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437; see also Blum, 465 U. S., at 902, n. 19 (\"A district court is expressly empowered to exercise discretion in determining whether an award is to be made and if so its reasonableness\"); id., at 896 (explaining that the proper standard of review of an attorney's fee award is abuse of discretion).  As was the case for the District Court here, that exercise of discretion can include, for example, whether a defendant is entitled to a reduction in hours where a plaintiff did not succeed on all his claims, and whether certain claimed expenses are reasonable.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a-26a.\n",
      "     If the majority is concerned that district courts are exercising the apportionment discretion afforded to them by §1997e(d)(2) in an uneven or unguided manner, the solution is not to read the conferral of discretion out of the statute entirely.  Instead, as occurred in the §1988(b) context, the Court could endorse a method for apportioning attorney's fee awards that can consistently be applied across cases.7  Just as courts ultimately were capable, through trial-and-error, of discerning an appropriate formula for assessing the reasonableness of a given fee award, see Delaware Valley, 478 U. S., at 562-565, so, too, are they capable of determining a sound approach to the apportionment decision envisioned by §1997e(d)(2).8\n",
      "     Second, even absent an equivalent method to the lodestar inquiry, §1997e(d)(2) does not, unlike the old 12-factor analysis for calculating fee awards, afford unlimited discretion.  Congress provided express bounds on a district court's apportionment discretion, requiring that it order the prevailing prisoner-plaintiff to contribute at least some part of his money judgment to the fee award but no more than 25 percent.\n",
      "     Finally, it is not obvious that the need for a more regimented approach with respect to calculating the amount of an attorney's fee award under §1988(b) should dictate the need for a similarly regimented approach with respect to the apportionment of responsibility for that award under §1997e(d)(2).  The two decisions involve fundamentally different inquiries: The first is focused on the prevailing-plaintiff's attorney and is concerned with determining a reasonable value for services rendered in pursuing the action, and the second is focused on the parties and is concerned with assessing the extent to which each party should bear responsibility for payment of those services (within the bounds set by Congress).  In light of these distinctions, the Court should hesitate to extrapolate wholesale from the considerations that drove the adoption of the lodestar rule to constrain the apportionment discretion afforded by §1997e(d)(2).\n",
      "III\n",
      "     On my reading of the plain text of §1997e(d)(2) and its surrounding statutory provisions and context, the proper interpretation of the provision is clear: District courts may exercise discretion in choosing the portion of the prisoner-plaintiff's monetary judgment that must go toward the attorney's fee award, so long as that choice is not greater than 25 percent of the judgment.  Because the majority holds that a prevailing prisoner-plaintiff must always yield 25 percent of his monetary judgment or, if less, the full amount of the fee award in every case, I respectfully dissent.\n",
      "\n",
      "FOOTNOTES\n",
      "Footnote 1 See Black's Law Dictionary 1543 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"satisfaction\" as \"[t]he fulfillment of an obligation; esp., the payment in full of a debt\"); 14 Oxford English Dictionary 504 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"satisfy\" as \"[t]o pay off or discharge fully; to liquidate (a debt); to fulfil completely (an obligation), comply with (a demand)\"); Webster's New International Dictionary 2220 (2d ed. 1950) (defining \"satisfy\" as \"1. In general, to fill up to the measure of a want of (a person or a thing); hence, to gratify fully the desire of . . . .  2. a To pay to the extent of claims or deserts; to give what is due to; as, to satisfy a creditor.  b To answer or discharge, as a claim, debt, legal demand, or the like; . . . to pay off \").\n",
      "Footnote 2 Even for those of us who might be inclined to entertain it, Mr. Murphy's legislative history argument fails to overcome the textual, contextual, and precedential evidence before us.  He points to an early draft of §1997e(d)(2) that read: \"Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action described in paragraph (1), a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant.  If the award of attorney's fees is greater than 25 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.\"  Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, S. 1279, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., §3(d), p. 16 (1995) (emphasis added).  Mr. Murphy admits that the italicized language in the second sentence suggests that it is the size of the attorney's fees award, not some invisible discretion, that determines what the defendant must pay.  Yet, he notes, the second sentence was revised in the legislative process and now reads: \"If the award of attorney's fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.\"  42 U. S. C. §1997e(d)(2) (emphasis added).  \n",
      "But what exactly does this amendment process prove, even taken on its own terms?  It shows that, at some stage of the bill's consideration, its proponents likely shared our understanding that the (still unchanged) first sentence doesn't give district courts the discretion to allocate fees to the defendant as they please.  For if such discretion were intended, it would have been incoherent for the drafters to say, in the second sentence, that defendants must pay only \"[i]f the award of attorney's fees is greater than 25 percent of the judgment,\" instead of whenever the district court chooses.  Beyond that, the amendment process tells us nothing.  Did legislators voting on the measure agree with our interpretation of the first sentence and drop the confirmatory language from the second as flabby duplication?  Or did they drop it because, as Mr. Murphy supposes, they thought it erroneous or even just bad policy?  Did anyone voting on the measure even think about this question?  There is no way to know, and we will not try to guess. \n",
      "FOOTNOTES\n",
      "Footnote 1 A similar conclusion obtains if one considers the average, rather than the median, damages award in a prisoner-civil-rights action litigated to victory, which in 2012 was $20,815.  See Trends in Prisoner Litigation 168 (Table 7).\n",
      "Footnote 2 The average such award in 1993, excluding one extreme outlier of $6.5 million, was $18,800.  See Trends in Prisoner Litigation 167; Schlanger, 116 Harv. L. Rev., at 1603.\n",
      "Footnote 3 In fact, even here, where the monetary judgment awarded to Murphy was well above the average award in prisoner-civil-rights cases, 25 percent of the judgment cannot fully discharge the fees awarded to his attorney.\n",
      "Footnote 4 Irrespective of what portion of the judgment the district court ultimately requires the prisoner-plaintiff to contribute to the fee award, the award will always be satisfied, i.e., paid in full, for once the prisonerplaintiff provides his contribution from the judgment, the defendant will be called upon to contribute the remainder.\n",
      "Footnote 5 Notably, such variation will be far less common under the majority's reading.  Given that the fee awards in prisoner-civil-rights victories almost always exceed the monetary judgments, see Part II-A, supra, on the majority's reading, it will be the rare case indeed when the \"portion\" of the judgment applied to the fee award will be anything other than 25 percent.\n",
      "Footnote 6 Of course, \"portion\" can gain a more determinate meaning by its surrounding context, as the majority's examples illustrate.  See ante, at 5.  But §1997e(d)(2) is not like the recipe that quantifies the initial portion of sugar to be doubled or the statutory provision that describes with geographic precision the lands to be made part of the National Elk Refuge.  \"[T]o satisfy\" simply instructs that some portion of the prisoner-plaintiff 's judgment \"not to exceed 25 percent\" be applied toward the satisfaction of the fee award.  See supra, at 6.  Section 1997e(d)(2) therefore lacks the clarifying details present in the majority's examples that would give fixed meaning to the word \"portion.\"\n",
      "Footnote 7 Such an apportionment method could, for example, account for a defendant's conduct during the litigation, just as the lodestar method considers the prevailing-plaintiff 's conduct in prosecuting the action.  A defendant that acts in ways that unnecessarily prolong or complicate the litigation so as to increase the plaintiff 's fees reasonably could be asked to bear a greater share of that expense.\n",
      "Footnote 8 Relatedly, the majority indicates concern with the District Court's lack of explanation for its choice of 10 percent.  See ante, at 8.  That procedural failure can easily be remedied by requiring district courts to explain their apportionment decisions so as to facilitate meaningful appellate review.\n",

Greene's Energy challenged the patent's validity in the District Court and also petitioned the PTO for inter partes review.  Both proceedings progressed in parallel.  The District Court issued a claim-construction order favoring Oil States, while the Board issued a decision concluding that Oil States' claims were unpatentable.  Oil States appealed to the Federal Circuit.  In addition to its patentability arguments, it challenged the constitutionality of inter partes review, arguing that actions to revoke a patent must be tried in an Article III court before a jury.  While the case was pending, the Federal Circuit issued a decision in a separate case, rejecting the same constitutional arguments raised by Oil States.  The court then summarily affirmed the Board's decision in this case.\n",
      "Held:\n",
      "     1. Inter partes review does not violate Article III.  Pp. 5-17.\n",
      "          (a) Under this Court's precedents, Congress has significant latitude to assign adjudication of public rights to entities other than Article III courts.  Executive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 573 U. S. ___, ___.  Inter partes review falls squarely within the public-rights doctrine.  The decision to grant a patent is a matter involving public rights.  Inter partes review is simply a reconsideration of that grant, and Congress has permissibly reserved the PTO's authority to conduct that reconsideration.  Pp. 5-10.\n",
      "               (i) The grant of a patent falls within the public-rights doctrine.  United States v. Duell, 172 U. S. 576, 582-583.  Granting a patent involves a matter \"arising between the government and others.\"  Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451.  Specifically, patents are \"public franchises.\" Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 533.  Additionally, granting patents is one of \"the constitutional functions\" that can be carried out by \"the executive or legislative departments\" without \" 'judicial determination.' \"  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50-51.  Pp. 7-8.\n",
      "               (ii) Inter partes review involves the same basic matter as the grant of a patent.  It is \"a second look at an earlier . . . grant,\" Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U. S. ___, ___, and it involves the same interests as the original grant, see Duell, supra, at 586.  That inter partes review occurs after the patent has issued does not make a difference here.  Patents remain \"subject to [the Board's] authority\" to cancel outside of an Article III court, Crowell, supra, at 50, and this Court has recognized that franchises can be qualified in this manner, see, e.g., Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, 242 U. S. 409, 421.  Pp. 8-10.\n",
      "          (b) Three decisions that recognize patent rights as the \"private property of the patentee,\" United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 128 U. S. 315, 370, do not contradict this conclusion.  See also McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. v. Aultman, 169 U. S. 606, 609; Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 197.  Nor do they foreclose the kind of post-issuance administrative review that Congress has authorized here.  Those cases were decided under the Patent Act of 1870 and are best read as describing the statutory scheme that existed at that time.  Pp. 10-11.\n",
      "          (c) Although patent validity was often decided in 18th-century English courts of law, that history does not establish that inter partes review violates the \"general\" principle that \"Congress may not 'withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law,\" Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. 462, 484.  Another means of canceling a patent at that time--a petition to the Privy Council to vacate a patent--closely resembles inter partes review.  The parties have cited nothing to suggest that the Framers were not aware of this common practice when writing the Patent Clause, or that they excluded the practice from the scope of the Clause.   Relatedly, the fact that American courts have traditionally adjudicated patent validity in this country does not mean that they must forever do so.  See post, at 8-10.  Historical practice is not decisive here because matters governed by the public-rights doctrine may be assigned to the Legislature, the Executive, or the Judiciary.  Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 451.  That Congress chose the courts in the past does not foreclose its choice of the PTO today.  Pp. 12-15.\n",
      "          (d) Finally, the similarities between the various procedures used in inter partes review and procedures typically used in courts does not lead to the conclusion that inter partes review violates Article III.  This Court has never adopted a \"looks like\" test to determine if an adjudication has improperly occurred outside an Article III court.  See, e.g., Williams v. United States, 289 U. S. 553, 563.  Pp. 15-16.\n",
      "          (e) This holding is narrow.  The Court addresses only the constitutionality of inter partes review and the precise constitutional challenges that Oil States raised here.  The decision should not be misconstrued as suggesting that patents are not property for purposes of the Due Process Clause or the Takings Clause.  Pp. 16-17.\n",
      "     2. Inter partes review does not violate the Seventh Amendment.  When Congress properly assigns a matter to adjudication in a non-Article III tribunal, \"the Seventh Amendment poses no independent bar to the adjudication of that action by a nonjury factfinder.\"  Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 52-53.  Thus, the rejection of Oil States' Article III challenge also resolves its Seventh Amendment challenge.  P. 17.\n",

The reexamination would follow the general procedures for initial examination, but would allow the third-party requester and the patent owner to participate in a limited manner by filing responses and replies.  §§314(a), (b) (2006 ed.).  Inter partes reexamination was phased out when the America Invents Act went into effect in 2012.  See §6, 125 Stat. 299-305.\n",

      "     The America Invents Act replaced inter partes reexamination with inter partes review, the procedure at issue here.  See id., at 299.  Any person other than the patent owner can file a petition for inter partes review.  35 U. S. C. §311(a) (2012 ed.).  The petition can request cancellation of \"1 or more claims of a patent\" on the grounds that the claim fails the novelty or nonobviousness standards for patentability.  §311(b).  The challenges must be made \"only on the basis of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications.\"  Ibid.  If a petition is filed, the patent owner has the right to file a preliminary response explaining why inter partes review should not be instituted.  §313.\n",
      "     Before he can institute inter partes review, the Director must determine \"that there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least 1 of the claims challenged.\"  §314(a).  The decision whether to institute inter partes review is committed to the Director's discretion.  See Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).  The Director's decision is \"final and nonappealable.\"  §314(d).1\n",
      "     Once inter partes review is instituted, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board--an adjudicatory body within the PTO created to conduct inter partes review--examines the patent's validity.  See 35 U. S. C. §§6, 316(c).  The Board sits in three-member panels of administrative patent judges.  See §6(c).  During the inter partes review, the petitioner and the patent owner are entitled to certain discovery, §316(a)(5); to file affidavits, declarations, and written memoranda, §316(a)(8); and to receive an oral hearing before the Board, §316(a)(10).  The petitioner has the burden of proving unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence.  §316(e).  The owner can file a motion to amend the patent by voluntarily canceling a claim or by \"propos[ing] a reasonable number of substitute claims.\"  §316(d)(1)(B).  The owner can also settle with the petitioner by filing a written agreement prior to the Board's final decision, which terminates the proceedings with respect to that petitioner.  §317.  If the settlement results in no petitioner remaining in the inter partes review, the Board can terminate the proceeding or issue a final written decision.  §317(a).\n",
      "     If the proceeding does not terminate, the Board must issue a final written decision no later than a year after it notices the institution of inter partes review, but that deadline can be extended up to six months for good cause.  §§316(a)(11), 318(a).  If the Board's decision becomes final, the Director must \"issue and publish a certificate.\"  §318(b).  The certificate cancels patent claims \"finally determined to be unpatentable,\" confirms patent claims \"determined to be patentable,\" and incorporates into the patent \"any new or amended claim determined to be patentable.\"  Ibid.\n",

      "     Petitioner Oil States Energy Services, LLC, and respondent Greene's Energy Group, LLC, are both oilfield services companies.  In 2001, Oil States obtained a patent relating to an apparatus and method for protecting wellhead equipment used in hydraulic fracturing.  In 2012, Oil States sued Greene's Energy in Federal District Court for infringing that patent.  Greene's Energy responded by challenging the patent's validity.  Near the close of discovery, Greene's Energy also petitioned the Board to institute inter partes review.  It argued that two of the patent's claims were unpatentable because they were anticipated by prior art not mentioned by Oil States in its original patent application.  Oil States filed a response opposing review.  The Board found that Greene's Energy had established a reasonable likelihood that the two claims were unpatentable and, thus, instituted inter partes review.\n",
      "     The proceedings before the District Court and the Board progressed in parallel.  In June 2014, the District Court issued a claim-construction order.  The order construed the challenged claims in a way that foreclosed Greene's Energy's arguments about the prior art.  But a few months later, the Board issued a final written decision concluding that the claims were unpatentable.  The Board acknowledged the District Court's contrary decision, but nonetheless concluded that the claims were anticipated by the prior art.\n",
      "     Oil States sought review in the Federal Circuit.  In addition to its arguments about patentability, Oil States challenged the constitutionality of inter partes review.  Specifically, it argued that actions to revoke a patent must be tried in an Article III court before a jury.  While Oil States' case was pending, the Federal Circuit issued an opinion in a different case, rejecting the same constitutional arguments.  MCM Portfolio LLC v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 812 F. 3d 1284, 1288-1293 (2015).  The Federal Circuit summarily affirmed the Board's decision in this case.  639 Fed. Appx. 639 (2016).\n",

      "III\n",
      "     Article III vests the judicial power of the United States \"in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\"  §1.  Consequently, Congress cannot \"confer the Government's 'judicial Power' on entities outside Article III.\"  Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. 462, 484 (2011).  When determining whether a proceeding involves an exercise of Article III judicial power, this Court's precedents have distinguished between \"public rights\" and \"private rights.\"  Executive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Those precedents have given Congress significant latitude to assign adjudication of public rights to entities other than Article III courts.  See ibid.; Stern, supra, at 488-492.\n",
      "     This Court has not \"definitively explained\" the distinction between public and private rights, Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, 69 (1982), and its precedents applying the public-rights doctrine have \"not been entirely consistent,\" Stern, 564 U. S., at 488.  But this case does not require us to add to the \"various formulations\" of the public-rights doctrine.  Ibid.  Our precedents have recognized that the doctrine covers matters \"which arise between the Government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments.\"  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 50 (1932).  In other words, the public-rights doctrine applies to matters \" 'arising between the government and others, which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it.' \"  Ibid. (quoting Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451 (1929)).  Inter partes review involves one such matter: reconsideration of the Government's decision to grant a public franchise.\n",
      "A\n",
      "     Inter partes review falls squarely within the public-rights doctrine.  This Court has recognized, and the parties do not dispute, that the decision to grant a patent is a matter involving public rights--specifically, the grant of a public franchise.  Inter partes review is simply a reconsideration of that grant, and Congress has permissibly reserved the PTO's authority to conduct that reconsideration.  Thus, the PTO can do so without violating Article III.\n",
      "1\n",
      "     This Court has long recognized that the grant of a patent is a \" 'matte[r] involving public rights.' \"  United States v. Duell, 172 U. S. 576, 582-583 (1899) (quoting Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284 (1856)).  It has the key features to fall within this Court's longstanding formulation of the public-rights doctrine.\n",
      "     Ab initio, the grant of a patent involves a matter \"arising between the government and others.\"  Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 451.  As this Court has long recognized, the grant of a patent is a matter between \" 'the public, who are the grantors, and . . . the patentee.' \"  Duell, supra, at 586 (quoting Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U. S. 50, 59 (1884)).  By \"issuing patents,\" the PTO \"take[s] from the public rights of immense value, and bestow[s] them upon the patentee.\"  United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 128 U. S. 315, 370 (1888).  Specifically, patents are \"public franchises\" that the Government grants \"to the inventors of new and useful improvements.\"  Seymour v. Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 533 (1871); accord, Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 63-64 (1998).  The franchise gives the patent owner \"the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention throughout the United States.\"  35 U. S. C. §154(a)(1).  That right \"did not exist at common law.\"  Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477, 494 (1851).  Rather, it is a \"creature of statute law.\"  Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works, 261 U. S. 24, 40 (1923).\n",
      "     Additionally, granting patents is one of \"the constitutional functions\" that can be carried out by \"the executive or legislative departments\" without \" 'judicial determination.' \"  Crowell, supra, at 50-51 (quoting Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 452).  Article I gives Congress the power \"[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\"  §8, cl. 8.  Congress can grant patents itself by statute.  See, e.g., Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 548-550 (1853).  And, from the founding to today, Congress has authorized the Executive Branch to grant patents that meet the statutory requirements for patentability.  See 35 U. S. C. §§2(a)(1), 151; see also Act of July 8, 1870, §31, 16 Stat. 202; Act of July 4, 1836, §7, 5 Stat. 119-120; Act of Apr. 10, 1790, ch. 7, §1, 1 Stat. 109-110.  When the PTO \"adjudicate[s] the patentability of inventions,\" it is \"exercising the executive power.\"  Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 910 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted).\n",
      "     Accordingly, the determination to grant a patent is a \"matte[r] involving public rights.\"  Murray's Lessee, supra, at 284.  It need not be adjudicated in Article III court.\n",
      "2\n",
      "     Inter partes review involves the same basic matter as the grant of a patent.  So it, too, falls on the public-rights side of the line.\n",
      "     Inter partes review is \"a second look at an earlier administrative grant of a patent.\"  Cuozzo, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  The Board considers the same statutory requirements that the PTO considered when granting the patent.  See 35 U. S. C. §311(b).  Those statutory requirements prevent the \"issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain.\"  Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 6 (1966).  So, like the PTO's initial review, the Board's inter partes review protects \"the public's paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope,\" Cuozzo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Thus, inter partes review involves the same interests as the determination to grant a patent in the first instance.  See Duell, supra, at 586.\n",
      "     The primary distinction between inter partes review and the initial grant of a patent is that inter partes review occurs after the patent has issued.  But that distinction does not make a difference here.  Patent claims are granted subject to the qualification that the PTO has \"the authority to reexamine--and perhaps cancel--a patent claim\" in an inter partes review.  See Cuozzo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3).  Patents thus remain \"subject to [the Board's] authority\" to cancel outside of an Article III court.  Crowell, 285 U. S., at 50.\n",
      "     This Court has recognized that franchises can be qualified in this manner.  For example, Congress can grant a franchise that permits a company to erect a toll bridge, but qualify the grant by reserving its authority to revoke or amend the franchise.  See, e.g., Louisville Bridge Co. v. United States, 242 U. S. 409, 421 (1917) (collecting cases).  Even after the bridge is built, the Government can exercise its reserved authority through legislation or an administrative proceeding.  See, e.g., id., at 420-421; Hannibal Bridge Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 194, 205 (1911); Bridge Co. v. United States, 105 U. S. 470, 478-482 (1882).  The same is true for franchises that permit companies to build railroads or telegraph lines.  See, e.g., United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., 160 U. S. 1, 24-25, 37-38 (1895).\n",
      "     Thus, the public-rights doctrine covers the matter resolved in inter partes review.  The Constitution does not prohibit the Board from resolving it outside of an Article III court.\n",
      "B\n",
      "     Oil States challenges this conclusion, citing three decisions that recognize patent rights as the \"private property of the patentee.\"  American Bell Telephone Co., 128 U. S., at 370; see also McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. v. Aultman, 169 U. S. 606, 609 (1898) (\"[A granted patent] has become the property of the patentee\"); Brown v. Du- chesne, 19 How. 183, 197 (1857) (\"[T]he rights of a party under a patent are his private property\").  But those cases do not contradict our conclusion.\n",
      "     Patents convey only a specific form of property right--a public franchise.  See Pfaff, 525 U. S., at 63-64.  And patents are \"entitled to protection as any other property, consisting of a franchise.\"  Seymour, 11 Wall. at 533 (emphasis added).  As a public franchise, a patent can confer only the rights that \"the statute prescribes.\"  Gayler, supra, at 494; Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 663-664 (1834) (noting that Congress has \"the power to prescribe the conditions on which such right shall be enjoyed\").  It is noteworthy that one of the precedents cited by Oil States acknowledges that the patentee's rights are \"derived altogether\" from statutes, \"are to be regulated and measured by these laws, and cannot go beyond them.\"  Brown, supra, at 195.2\n",
      "     One such regulation is inter partes review.  See Cuozzo, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  The Patent Act provides that, \"[s]ubject to the provisions of this title, patents shall have the attributes of personal property.\"  35 U. S. C. §261.  This provision qualifies any property rights that a patent owner has in an issued patent, subjecting them to the express provisions of the Patent Act.  See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 392 (2006).  Those provisions include inter partes review.  See §§311-319.\n",
      "     Nor do the precedents that Oil States cites foreclose the kind of post-issuance administrative review that Congress has authorized here.  To be sure, two of the cases make broad declarations that \"[t]he only authority competent to set a patent aside, or to annul it, or to correct it for any reason whatever, is vested in the courts of the United States, and not in the department which issued the patent.\"  McCormick Harvesting Machine Co., supra, at 609; accord, American Bell Telephone Co., 128 U. S., at 364.  But those cases were decided under the Patent Act of 1870.  See id., at 371; McCormick Harvesting Machine Co., supra, at 611.  That version of the Patent Act did not include any provision for post-issuance administrative review.  Those precedents, then, are best read as a description of the statutory scheme that existed at that time.  They do not resolve Congress' authority under the Constitution to establish a different scheme.3\n",
      "C\n",
      "     Oil States and the dissent contend that inter partes review violates the \"general\" principle that \"Congress may not 'withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.' \"  Stern, 564 U. S., at 484 (quoting Murray's Lessee, 18 How., at 284).  They argue that this is so because patent validity was often decided in English courts of law in the 18th century.  For example, if a patent owner brought an infringement action, the defendant could challenge the validity of the patent as an affirmative defense.  See Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide If Patents Are Valid? 99 Va. L. Rev. 1673, 1682, 1685-1686, and n. 52 (2013).  Or, an individual could challenge the validity of a patent by filing a writ of scire facias in the Court of Chancery, which would sit as a law court when adjudicating the writ.  See id., at 1683-1685, and n. 44; Bottomley, Patent Cases in the Court of Chancery, 1714-58, 35 J. Legal Hist. 27, 36-37, 41-43 (2014).\n",
      "     But this history does not establish that patent validity is a matter that, \"from its nature,\" must be decided by a court.  Stern, supra, at 484 (quoting Murray's Lessee, supra, at 284).  The aforementioned proceedings were between private parties.  But there was another means of canceling a patent in 18th-century England, which more closely resembles inter partes review: a petition to the Privy Council to vacate a patent.  See Lemley, supra, at 1681-1682; Hulme, Privy Council Law and Practice of Letters Patent for Invention From the Restoration to 1794, 33 L. Q. Rev. 63 (1917).  The Privy Council was composed of the Crown's advisers.  Lemley, supra, at 1681.  From the 17th through the 20th centuries, English patents had a standard revocation clause that permitted six or more Privy Counsellors to declare a patent void if they determined the invention was contrary to law, \"prejudicial\" or \"inconvenient,\" not new, or not invented by the patent owner.  See 11 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 426-427, and n. 6 (1938); Davies, The Early History of the Patent Specification, 50 L. Q. Rev. 86, 102-106 (1934).  Individuals could petition the Council to revoke a patent, and the petition was referred to the Attorney General.  The Attorney General examined the petition, considered affidavits from the petitioner and patent owner, and heard from counsel.  See, e.g., Bull v. Lydall, PC2/81, pp. 180-181 (1706).  Depending on the Attorney General's conclusion, the Council would either void the patent or dismiss the petition.  See, e.g., Darby v. Betton, PC2/99, pp. 358-359 (1745-1746) (voiding the patent); Baker v. James, PC2/103, pp. 320-321, 346-347 (1752) (dismissing the petition).\n",
      "     The Privy Council was a prominent feature of the English system.  It had exclusive authority to revoke patents until 1753, and after that, it had concurrent jurisdiction with the courts.  See Hulme, 33 L. Q. Rev., at 189-191, 193-194.  The Privy Council continued to consider revocation claims and to revoke patents throughout the 18th century.  Its last revocation was in 1779.  See id., at 192-193.  It considered, but did not act on, revocation claims in 1782, 1794, and 1810.  See ibid.; Board of Ordinance v. Parr, PC1/3919 (1810).\n",
      "     The Patent Clause in our Constitution \"was written against the backdrop\" of the English system.  Graham, 383 U. S., at 5.  Based on the practice of the Privy Council, it was well understood at the founding that a patent system could include a practice of granting patents subject to potential cancellation in the executive proceeding of the Privy Council.  The parties have cited nothing in the text or history of the Patent Clause or Article III to suggest that the Framers were not aware of this common practice.  Nor is there any reason to think they excluded this practice during their deliberations.  And this Court has recognized that, \"[w]ithin the scope established by the Constitution, Congress may set out conditions and tests for patentability.\"  Id., at 6.  We conclude that inter partes review is one of those conditions.4\n",
      "     For similar reasons, we disagree with the dissent's assumption that, because courts have traditionally adjudicated patent validity in this country, courts must forever continue to do so.  See post, at 8-10.  Historical practice is not decisive here because matters governed by the public-rights doctrine \"from their nature\" can be resolved in multiple ways: Congress can \"reserve to itself the power to decide,\" \"delegate that power to executive officers,\" or \"commit it to judicial tribunals.\"  Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S., at 451.  That Congress chose the courts in the past does not foreclose its choice of the PTO today.\n",
      "D\n",
      "     Finally, Oil States argues that inter partes review violates Article III because it shares \"every salient characteristic associated with the exercise of the judicial power.\"  Brief for Petitioner 20.  Oil States highlights various procedures used in inter partes review: motion practice before the Board; discovery, depositions, and cross-examination of witnesses; introduction of evidence and objections based on the Federal Rules of Evidence; and an adversarial hearing before the Board.  See 35 U. S. C. §316(a); 77 Fed. Reg. 48758, 48761-48763 (2012).  Similarly, Oil States cites PTO regulations that use terms typically associated with courts--calling the hearing a \"trial,\" id., at 48758; the Board members \"judges,\" id., at 48763; and the Board's final decision a \"judgment,\" id., at 48761, 48766-48767.\n",
      "     But this Court has never adopted a \"looks like\" test to determine if an adjudication has improperly occurred outside of an Article III court.  The fact that an agency uses court-like procedures does not necessarily mean it is exercising the judicial power.  See Freytag, 501 U. S., at 910 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  This Court has rejected the notion that a tribunal exercises Article III judicial power simply because it is \"called a court and its decisions called judgments.\"  Williams v. United States, 289 U. S. 553, 563 (1933).  Nor does the fact that an administrative adjudication is final and binding on an individual who acquiesces in the result necessarily make it an exercise of the judicial power.  See, e.g., Murray's Lessee, 18 How., at 280-281 (permitting the Treasury Department to conduct \"final and binding\" audits outside of an Article III court).  Although inter partes review includes some of the features of adversarial litigation, it does not make any binding determination regarding \"the liability of [Greene's Energy] to [Oil States] under the law as defined.\"  Crowell, 285 U. S., at 51.  It remains a matter involving public rights, one \"between the government and others, which from [its] nature do[es] not require judicial determination.\"  Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S., at 451.5\n",
      "E\n",
      "     We emphasize the narrowness of our holding.  We address the constitutionality of inter partes review only.  We do not address whether other patent matters, such as infringement actions, can be heard in a non-Article III forum.  And because the Patent Act provides for judicial review by the Federal Circuit, see 35 U. S. C. §319, we need not consider whether inter partes review would be constitutional \"without any sort of intervention by a court at any stage of the proceedings,\" Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 430 U. S. 442, 455, n. 13 (1977).  Moreover, we address only the precise constitutional challenges that Oil States raised here.  Oil States does not challenge the retroactive application of inter partes review, even though that procedure was not in place when its patent issued.  Nor has Oil States raised a due process challenge.  Finally, our decision should not be misconstrued as suggesting that patents are not property for purposes of the Due Process Clause or the Takings Clause.  See, e.g., Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 642 (1999); James v. Campbell, 104 U. S. 356, 358 (1882).\n",
      "IV\n",
      "     In addition to Article III, Oil States challenges inter partes review under the Seventh Amendment.  The Seventh Amendment preserves the \"right of trial by jury\" in \"Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars.\"  This Court's precedents establish that, when Congress properly assigns a matter to adjudication in a non-Article III tribunal, \"the Seventh Amendment poses no independent bar to the adjudication of that action by a nonjury factfinder.\"  Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 53-54 (1989); accord, Atlas Roofing Co., supra, at 450-455.  No party challenges or attempts to distinguish those precedents.  Thus, our rejection of Oil States' Article III challenge also resolves its Seventh Amendment challenge.  Because inter partes review is a matter that Congress can properly assign to the PTO, a jury is not necessary in these proceedings.\n",

Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 853-856 (1986); see also Stern, supra, at 513 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\"The presence of 'private rights' does not automatically determine the outcome of the question but requires a more 'searching' examination of the relevant factors\"). \n",

      "     After much hard work and no little investment you devise something you think truly novel.  Then you endure the further cost and effort of applying for a patent, devoting maybe $30,000 and two years to that process alone.  At the end of it all, the Patent Office agrees your invention is novel and issues a patent.  The patent affords you exclusive rights to the fruits of your labor for two decades.  But what happens if someone later emerges from the woodwork, arguing that it was all a mistake and your patent should be canceled?  Can a political appointee and his administrative agents, instead of an independent judge, resolve the dispute?  The Court says yes.  Respectfully, I disagree.\n",
      "     We sometimes take it for granted today that independent judges will hear our cases and controversies.  But it wasn't always so.  Before the Revolution, colonial judges depended on the crown for their tenure and salary and often enough their decisions followed their interests.  The problem was so serious that the founders cited it in their Declaration of Independence (see ¶11).  Once free, the framers went to great lengths to guarantee a degree of judicial independence for future generations that they themselves had not experienced.  Under the Constitution, judges \"hold their Offices during good Behaviour\" and their \"Compensation . . . shall not be diminished during the[ir] Continuance in Office.\"  Art. III, §1.  The framers knew that \"a fixed provision\" for judges' financial support would help secure \"the independence of the judges,\" because \"a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will.\"  The Federalist No. 79, p. 472 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted).  They were convinced, too, that \"[p]eriodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to [the courts'] necessary independence.\"  The Federalist No. 78, at 471 (A. Hamilton).\n",
      "     Today, the government invites us to retreat from the promise of judicial independence.  Until recently, most everyone considered an issued patent a personal right--no less than a home or farm--that the federal government could revoke only with the concurrence of independent judges.  But in the statute before us Congress has tapped an executive agency, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, for the job.  Supporters say this is a good thing because the Patent Office issues too many low quality patents; allowing a subdivision of that office to clean up problems after the fact, they assure us, promises an efficient solution.  And, no doubt, dispensing with constitutionally prescribed procedures is often expedient.  Whether it is the guarantee of a warrant before a search, a jury trial before a conviction--or, yes, a judicial hearing before a property interest is stripped away--the Constitution's constraints can slow things down.  But economy supplies no license for ignoring these--often vitally inefficient-- protections.  The Constitution \"reflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government outweigh the costs,\" and it is not our place to replace that judgment with our own.  United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. 460, 470 (2010).\n",
      "     Consider just how efficient the statute before us is.  The Director of the Patent Office is a political appointee who serves at the pleasure of the President.  35 U. S. C. §§3(a)(1), (a)(4).  He supervises and pays the Board members responsible for deciding patent disputes.  §§1(a), 3(b)(6), 6(a).  The Director is allowed to select which of these members, and how many of them, will hear any particular patent challenge.  See §6(c).  If they (somehow) reach a result he does not like, the Director can add more members to the panel--including himself--and order the case reheard.  See §§6(a), (c); In re Alappat, 33 F. 3d 1526, 1535 (CA Fed. 1994) (en banc); Nidec Motor Corp. v. Zhongshan Broad Ocean Motor Co. Ltd., 868 F. 3d 1013, 1020 (CA Fed. 2013) (Dyk, J., concurring), cert. pending, No. 17-751.  Nor has the Director proven bashful about asserting these statutory powers to secure the \" 'policy judgments' \" he seeks.  Brief for Petitioner 46 (quoting Patent Office Solicitor); see also Brief for Shire Pharmaceuticals LLC as Amicus Curiae 22-30.\n",
      "     No doubt this efficient scheme is well intended.  But can there be any doubt that it also represents a retreat from the promise of judicial independence?  Or that when an independent Judiciary gives ground to bureaucrats in the adjudication of cases, the losers will often prove the unpopular and vulnerable?  Powerful interests are capable of amassing armies of lobbyists and lawyers to influence (and even capture) politically accountable bureaucracies.  But what about everyone else?\n",
      "     Of course, all this invites the question: how do we know which cases independent judges must hear?  The Constitution's original public meaning supplies the key, for the Constitution cannot secure the people's liberty any less today than it did the day it was ratified.  The relevant constitutional provision, Article III, explains that the federal \"judicial Power\" is vested in independent judges.  As originally understood, the judicial power extended to \"suit[s] at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.\"  Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284 (1856).  From this and as we've recently explained, it follows that, \"[w]hen a suit is made of the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the courts at Westminster in 1789 . . . and is brought within the bounds of federal jurisdiction, the responsibility for deciding that suit rests with\" Article III judges endowed with the protections for their independence the framers thought so important.  Stern v. Marshall, 564 U. S. 462, 484 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court does not quarrel with this test.  See ante, at 12-14.  We part ways only on its application.1\n",
      "     As I read the historical record presented to us, only courts could hear patent challenges in England at the time of the founding.  If facts were in dispute, the matter first had to proceed in the law courts.  See, e.g., Newsham v. Gray, 2 Atk. 286, 26 Eng. Rep. 575 (Ch. 1742).  If successful there, a challenger then had to obtain a writ of scire facias in the law side of the Court of Chancery.  See, e.g., Pfander, Jurisdiction-Stripping and the Supreme Court's Power To Supervise Inferior Tribunals, 78 Texas L. Rev. 1433, 1446, n. 53 (2000); Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide If Patents Are Valid? 99 Va. L. Rev. 1673, 1686-1687 (2013) (Lemley, Juries).  The last time an executive body (the King's Privy Council) invalidated an invention patent on an ordinary application was in 1746, in Darby v. Betton, PC2/99, pp. 358-359; and the last time the Privy Council even considered doing so was in 1753, in Baker v. James, PC2/103, pp. 320-321.  After Baker v. James, the Privy Council \"divest[ed] itself of its functions\" in ordinary patent disputes, Hulme, Privy Council Law and Practice of Letters Patent for Invention from the Restoration to 1794 (Pt. II), 33 L. Q. Rev. 180, 194 (1917), which \"thereafter [were] adjudicated solely by the law courts, as opposed to the [crown's] prerogative courts,\" Mossoff, Rethinking the Development of Patents: An Intellectual History, 1550-1800, 52 Hastings L. J. 1255, 1286-1287 (2001) (Mossoff, Rethinking Patents).2\n",
      "     This shift to courts paralleled a shift in thinking.  Patents began as little more than feudal favors.  Id., at 1261.  The crown both issued and revoked them.  Lemley, Juries 1680-1681.  And they often permitted the lucky recipient the exclusive right to do very ordinary things, like operate a toll bridge or run a tavern.  Ibid.  But by the 18th century, inventors were busy in Britain and invention patents came to be seen in a different light.  They came to be viewed not as endowing accidental and anticompetitive monopolies on the fortunate few but as a procompetitive means to secure to individuals the fruits of their labor and ingenuity; encourage others to emulate them; and promote public access to new technologies that would not otherwise exist.  Mossoff, Rethinking Patents 1288-1289.  The Constitution itself reflects this new thinking, authorizing the issuance of patents precisely because of their contribution to the \"Progress of Science and useful Arts.\"  Art. I, §8, cl. 8.  \"In essence, there was a change in perception--from viewing a patent as a contract between the crown and the patentee to viewing it as a 'social contract' between the patentee and society.\"  Waltersheid, The Early Evolution of the United States Patent Law: Antecedents (Part 3), 77 J. Pat. & T. Off. Soc. 771, 793 (1995).  And as invention patents came to be seen so differently, it is no surprise courts came to treat them more solicitously.3\n",
      "     Unable to dispute that judges alone resolved virtually all patent challenges by the time of the founding, the Court points to three English cases that represent the Privy Council's dying gasp in this area: Board of Ordnance v. Wilkinson, PC2/123 (1779); Grill [Grice] v. Waters, PC2/127 (1782); and Board of Ordnance v. Parr, PC1/3919 (1810).4  Filed in 1779, 1782, and 1810, each involved an effort to override a patent on munitions during wartime, no doubt in an effort to increase their supply.  But even then appealing to the Privy Council was seen as a last resort.  The 1779 petition (the last Privy Council revocation ever) came only after the patentee twice refused instructions to litigate the patent's validity in a court of law.  Gómez-Arostegui & Bottomley, Privy Council and Scire Facias 1700-1883, p. 6 (Nov. 6, 2017) https://ssrn.com/abstract=3054989 (citing Board of Ordnance v. Wilkinson, PC2/123 (1779), and PC1/11/150 (1779)).  The Council did not act on the 1782 petition but instead referred it to the Attorney General where it appears to have been abandoned.  Gómez-Arostegui & Bottomley, Privy Council and Scire Facias, supra, at 17-18.  Meanwhile, in response to the 1810 petition the Attorney General admitted that scire facias was the \"usual manner\" of revoking a patent and so directed the petitioner to proceed at law even as he suggested the Privy Council might be available in the event of a \"very pressing and imminent\" danger to the public.  Id., at 20 (citing PC1/3919 (1810)).\n",
      "     In the end, these cases do very little to support the Court's holding.  At most, they suggest that the Privy Council might have possessed some residual power to revoke patents to address wartime necessities.  Equally, they might serve only as more unfortunate evidence of the maxim that in time of war, the laws fall silent.5  But whatever they do, these cases do not come close to proving that patent disputes were routinely permitted to proceed outside a court of law.\n",
      "     Any lingering doubt about English law is resolved for me by looking to our own.  While the Court is correct that the Constitution's Patent Clause \" 'was written against the backdrop' \" of English practice, ante, at 14 (quoting Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 5 (1966)), it's also true that the Clause sought to reject some of early English practice.  Reflecting the growing sentiment that patents shouldn't be used for anticompetitive monopolies over \"goods or businesses which had long before been enjoyed by the public,\" the framers wrote the Clause to protect only procompetitive invention patents that are the product of hard work and insight and \"add to the sum of useful knowledge.\"  Id., at 5-6.  In light of the Patent Clause's restrictions on this score, courts took the view that when the federal government \"grants a patent the grantee is entitled to it as a matter of right, and does not receive it, as was originally supposed to be the case in England, as a matter of grace and favor.\"  James v. Campbell, 104 U. S. 356, 358 (1882) (emphasis added).  As Chief Justice Marshall explained, courts treated American invention patents as recognizing an \"inchoate property\" that exists \"from the moment of invention.\"  Evans v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872, 873 (No. 4,564) (CC Va. 1813).  American patent holders thus were thought to \"hol[d] a property in [their] invention[s] by as good a title as the farmer holds his farm and flock.\"  Hovey v. Henry, 12 F. Cas. 603, 604 (No. 6,742) (CC Mass. 1846) (Woodbury, J.).  And just as with farm and flock, it was widely accepted that the government could divest patent owners of their rights only through proceedings before independent judges.\n",
      "     This view held firm for most of our history.  In fact, from the time it established the American patent system in 1790 until about 1980, Congress left the job of invalidating patents at the federal level to courts alone.  The only apparent exception to this rule cited to us was a 4 year period when foreign patentees had to \"work\" or commercialize their patents or risk having them revoked.  Hovenkamp, The Emergence of Classical American Patent Law, 58 Ariz. L. Rev. 263, 283-284 (2016).  And the fact that for almost 200 years \"earlier Congresses avoided use of [a] highly attractive\"--and surely more efficient--means for extinguishing patents should serve as good \"reason to believe that the power was thought not to exist\" at the time of the founding.  Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 905 (1997).\n",
      "     One more episode still underscores the point.  When the Executive sought to claim the right to cancel a patent in the 1800s, this Court firmly rebuffed the effort.  The Court explained:\n",
      "\"It has been settled by repeated decisions of this court that when a patent has [been issued by] the Patent Office, it has passed beyond the control and jurisdiction of that office, and is not subject to be revoked or cancelled by the President, or any other officer of the Government.  It has become the property of the patentee, and as such is entitled to the same legal protection as other property.\"  McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. v. Aultman, 169 U. S. 606, 608-609 (1898) (citations omitted).\n",
      "As a result, the Court held, \"[t]he only authority competent to set a patent aside, or to annul it, or to correct it for any reason whatever, is vested in the courts of the United States, and not in the department which issued the patent.\"  Id., at 609.\n",
      "     The Court today replies that McCormick sought only to interpret certain statutes then in force, not the Constitution.  Ante, at 11, and n. 3.  But this much is hard to see.  Allowing the Executive to withdraw a patent, McCormick said, \"would be to deprive the applicant of his property without due process of law, and would be in fact an invasion of the judicial branch of the government by the executive.\"  169 U. S., at 612.  McCormick also pointed to \"repeated decisions\" in similar cases that themselves do not seem to rest merely on statutory grounds.  See id., at 608-609 (citing United States v. Schurz, 102 U. S. 378 (1880), and United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 128 U. S. 315 (1888)).  And McCormick equated invention patents with land patents.  169 U. S., at 609.  That is significant because, while the Executive has always dispensed public lands to homesteaders and other private persons, it has never been constitutionally empowered to withdraw land patents from their recipients (or their successors-in-interest) except through a \"judgment of a court.\" United States v. Stone, 2 Wall. 525, 535 (1865); Wellness Int'l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11) (\"Although Congress could authorize executive agencies to dispose of public rights in lands--often by means of adjudicating a claimant's qualifications for a land grant under a statute--the United States had to go to the courts if it wished to revoke a patent\" (emphasis deleted)).\n",
      "     With so much in the relevant history and precedent against it, the Court invites us to look elsewhere.  Instead of focusing on the revocation of patents, it asks us to abstract the level of our inquiry and focus on their issuance.  Because the job of issuing invention patents traditionally belonged to the Executive, the Court proceeds to argue, the job of revoking them can be left there too.  Ante, at 6-10.  But that doesn't follow.  Just because you give a gift doesn't mean you forever enjoy the right to reclaim it.  And, as we've seen, just because the Executive could issue an invention (or land) patent did not mean the Executive could revoke it.  To reward those who had proven the social utility of their work (and to induce others to follow suit), the law long afforded patent holders more protection than that against the threat of governmental intrusion and dispossession.  The law requires us to honor those historical rights, not diminish them.\n",
      "     Still, the Court asks us to look away in yet another direction.  At the founding, the Court notes, the Executive could sometimes both dispense and revoke public franchises.  And because, it says, invention patents are a species of public franchises, the Court argues the Executive should be allowed to dispense and revoke them too.  Ante, at 9-10.       But labels aside, by the time of the founding the law treated patents protected by the Patent Clause quite differently from ordinary public franchises.  Many public franchises amounted to little more than favors resembling the original royal patents the framers expressly refused to protect in the Patent Clause.  The Court points to a good example: the state-granted exclusive right to operate a toll bridge.  Ante, at 9.  By the founding, courts in this country (as in England) had come to view anticompetitive monopolies like that with disfavor, narrowly construing the rights they conferred.  See Proprietors of Charles River Bridge v. Proprietors of Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 544 (1837).  By contrast, courts routinely applied to invention patents protected by the Patent Clause the \"liberal common sense construction\" that applies to other instruments creating private property rights, like land deeds.  Davis v. Palmer, 7 F. Cas. 154, 158 (No. 3,645) (CC Va. 1827) (Marshall, C. J.); see also Mossoff, Reevaluating the Patent Privilege 990 (listing more differences in treatment).  As Justice Story explained, invention patents protected by the Patent Clause were \"not to be treated as mere monopolies odious in the eyes of the law, and therefore not to be favored.\"  Ames v. Howard, 1 F. Cas. 755, 756 (No. 326) (CC Mass. 1833).  For precisely these reasons and as we've seen, the law traditionally treated patents issued under the Patent Clause very differently than monopoly franchises when it came to governmental invasions.  Patents alone required independent judges.  Nor can simply invoking a mismatched label obscure that fact.  The people's historic rights to have independent judges decide their disputes with the government should not be a \"constitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented\" by such \"simpl[e] maneuver[s].\" Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (Roberts, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12).\n",
      "     Today's decision may not represent a rout but it at least signals a retreat from Article III's guarantees.  Ceding to the political branches ground they wish to take in the name of efficient government may seem like an act of judicial restraint.  But enforcing Article III isn't about protecting judicial authority for its own sake.  It's about ensuring the people today and tomorrow enjoy no fewer rights against governmental intrusion than those who came before.  And the loss of the right to an independent judge is never a small thing.  It's for that reason Hamilton warned the judiciary to take \"all possible care . . . to defend itself against\" intrusions by the other branches.  The Federalist No. 78, at 466.  It's for that reason I respectfully dissent.\n",

      "Footnote 2 This Court has also recognized this dynamic for state-issued franchises.  For instance, States often reserve the right to alter or revoke a corporate charter either \"in the act of incorporation or in some general law of the State which was in operation at the time the charter was granted.\"  Pennsylvania College Cases, 13 Wall. 190, 214, and n. † (1872).  That reservation remains effective even after the corporation comes into existence, and such alterations do not offend the Contracts Clause of Article I, §10.

      "Footnote 3 The dissent points to McCormick's statement that the Patent Office Commissioner could not invalidate the patent at issue because it would \" 'deprive the applicant of his property without due process of law, and would be in fact an invasion of the judicial branch.' \"  Post, at 10 (quoting McCormick Harvesting Machine Co. v. Aultman, 169 U. S. 606, 612 (1898)).  But that statement followed naturally from the Court's determination that, under the Patent Act of 1870, the Commissioner \"was functus officio\" and \"had no power to revoke, cancel, or annul\" the patent at issue.  169 U. S., at 611-612.\n",
      "Nor is it significant that the McCormick Court \"equated invention patents with land patents.\"  Post, at 10.  McCormick itself makes clear that the analogy between the two depended on the particulars of the Patent Act of 1870.  See 169 U. S., at 609-610.  Modern invention patents, by contrast, are meaningfully different from land patents.  The land-patent cases invoked by the dissent involved a \"transaction [in which] 'all authority or control' over the lands has passed from 'the Executive Department.' \"  Boesche v. Udall, 373 U. S. 472, 477 (1963) (quoting Moore v. Robbins, 96 U. S. 530, 533 (1878)).  Their holdings do not apply when \"the Government continues to possess some measure of control over\" the right in question.  Boesche, 373 U. S., at 477; see id., at 477-478 (affirming administrative cancellations of public-land leases).  And that is true of modern invention patents under the current Patent Act, which gives the PTO continuing authority to review and potentially cancel patents after they are issued.  See 35 U. S. C. §§261, 311-319.\n",
      "Footnote 4 Oil States also suggests that inter partes review could be an unconstitutional condition because it conditions the benefit of a patent on accepting the possibility of inter partes review.  Cf. Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management Dist., 570 U. S. 595, 604 (2013) (\"[T]he government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a constitutional right\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Even assuming a patent is a \"benefit\" for purposes of the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, that doctrine does not apply here.  The doctrine prevents the Government from using conditions \"to produce a result which it could not command directly.\"  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 597 (1972) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  But inter partes review is consistent with Article III, see Part III-A, supra, and falls within Congress' Article I authority, see Part III-C, supra, so it is something Congress can \"command directly,\" Perry, supra, at 597.\n",
      "Footnote 5 Oil States also points out that inter partes review \"is initiated by private parties and implicates no waiver of sovereign immunity.\"  Brief for Petitioner 30-31.  But neither of those features takes inter partes review outside of the public-rights doctrine.  That much is clear from United States v. Duell, 172 U. S. 576 (1899), which held that the doctrine covers interference proceedings--a procedure to \"determin[e] which of two claimants is entitled to a patent\"--even though interference proceedings were initiated by \" 'private interests compet[ing] for preference' \" and did not involve a waiver of sovereign immunity.  Id., at 582, 586 (quoting Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U. S. 50, 59 (1884)).  Also, inter partes review is not initiated by private parties in the way that a common-law cause of action is.  To be sure, a private party files the petition for review.  35 U. S. C. §311(a).  But the decision to institute review is made by the Director and committed to his unreviewable discretion.  See Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).\n",

      "Federal district courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state claims not otherwise within their adjudicatory authority if those claims are \"part of the same case or controversy\" as the federal claims the plaintiff asserts.  28 U. S. C. §1367(a).  When a district court dismisses all claims independently qualifying for the exercise of federal jurisdiction, it ordinarily also dismisses all related state claims.  See §1367(c)(3).  Section 1367(d) provides that the \"period of limitations for\" refiling in state court a state claim so dismissed \"shall be tolled while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"  \n",
      "          When petitioner Artis filed a federal-court suit against respondent District of Columbia (District), alleging a federal employment-discrimination claim and three allied claims under D. C. law, nearly two years remained on the applicable statute of limitations for the D. C.-law violations.  Two and a half years later, the Federal District Court ruled against Artis on her sole federal claim and dismissed the D. C.-law claims under §1367(c).  Fifty-nine days after the dismissal, Artis refiled her state-law claims in the D. C. Superior Court, but that court dismissed them as time barred.  The D. C. Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that §1367(d) accorded Artis only a 30-day grace period to refile in state court and rejecting her argument that the word \"tolled\" in §1367(d) means that the limitations period is suspended during the pendency of the federal suit.  \n",
      "Held: \n",
      "     1. Section 1367(d)'s instruction to \"toll\" a state limitations period means to hold it in abeyance, i.e., to stop the clock.  Pp. 7-16.\n",
      "          (a) Statutes that shelter from time bars claims earlier commenced in another forum generally employ one of two means.  First, the period of limitations may be \"tolled,\" i.e., suspended, while the claim is pending elsewhere; the time clock starts running again when the tolling period ends, picking up where it left off.  A legislature may instead elect simply to provide a grace period, permitting the statute of limitations to run while the claim is pending in another forum and averting the risk of a time bar by according the plaintiff a fixed period in which to refile.  The District has identified no federal statute in which a grace-period meaning has been ascribed to the word \"tolled\" or any word similarly rooted.  And the one case in which this Court used tolling language to describe a grace period, see Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536, is a feather on the scale against the weight of decisions in which \"tolling\" a statute of limitations signals stopping the clock.  Pp. 7-11.\n",
      "          (b) Considering first the ordinary meaning of the statutory language, §1367(d) is phrased as a tolling provision.  It suspends the statute of limitations both while the claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days postdismissal.  Artis' interpretation is a natural fit with this language.  The District, in contrast, reads \"tolled\" to mean to remove, temporarily, the bar that would ordinarily accompany the expiration of the limitations period.  But the District offers no reason to home in only on the word \"tolled\" itself and ignore information about the verb's ordinary meaning gained from its grammatical object, \"period of limitations.\"  That object sheds light on what it means to \"be tolled.\"  The District's reading also tenders a strained interpretation of the phrase \"period of limitations\"; makes the first portion of the tolling period, the duration of the claim's pendency in federal court, superfluous; and could yield an absurdity, permitting a plaintiff to refile in state court even if the limitations period on her claim had expired before she filed in federal court.  Pp. 11-13.\n",
      "          (c) The D. C. Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Congress adopted an American Law Institute (ALI) recommendation to allow refiling in state court only for 30 days after a dismissal.  The ALI provision, like §1367(d), established a 30-day federal floor on the time allowed for refiling, but it did not provide for tolling \"while the [state] claim is pending\" in federal court.  Pp. 13-14.\n",
      "          (d) The 30-day provision casts no large shadow on Artis' stop-the-clock interpretation.  The provision accounts for cases in which a plaintiff commenced a federal action close to the expiration date of the relevant state statute of limitations, by giving such a plaintiff breathing space to refile in state court.  Adding a brief span of days to the tolling period is not unusual in stop-the-clock statutes.  See, e.g., 46 U. S. C. §53911.  Section 1367(d)'s proviso \"unless State law provides for a longer tolling period\" could similarly aid a plaintiff who filed in federal court just short of the expiration of the state limitations period.  Pp. 14-16.\n",
      "     2. The stop-the-clock interpretation of §1367(d) does not present a serious constitutional problem.  In Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, the Court rejected an argument that §1367(d) impermissibly exceeds Congress' authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.  Id., at 464-465.  The District contends that a stop-the-clock prescription serves \"no federal purpose\" that could not be served by a grace-period prescription.  But both devices are standard, off-the-shelf means of accounting for the fact that a claim was timely pressed in another forum.  Requiring Congress to choose one over the other would impose a tighter constraint on Congress' discretion than this Court has countenanced.  A concern that a stop-the-clock prescription entails a greater imposition on the States than a grace-period prescription may also be more theoretical than real.  Finally, a stop-the-clock rule like §1367(d) is suited to the primary purposes of limitations statutes: \" 'preventing surprises' \" to defendants and \" 'barring a plaintiff who has slept on his rights.' \"  American Pipe & Constr.

      "     Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n",
      "     The Supplemental Jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. §1367, enables federal district courts to entertain claims not otherwise within their adjudicatory authority when those claims \"are so related to claims . . . within [federal-court competence] that they form part of the same case or controversy.\"  §1367(a).  Included within this supplemental jurisdiction are state claims brought along with federal claims arising from the same episode.  When district courts dismiss all claims independently qualifying for the exercise of federal jurisdiction, they ordinarily dismiss as well all related state claims.  See §1367(c)(3).  A district court may also dismiss the related state claims if there is a good reason to decline jurisdiction.  See §1367(c)(1), (2), and (4).  This case concerns the time within which state claims so dismissed may be refiled in state court.\n",
      "     Section 1367(d), addressing that issue, provides:\n",
      "\"The period of limitations for any [state] claim [ joined with a claim within federal-court competence] shall be tolled while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"\n",
      "The question presented: Does the word \"tolled,\" as used in §1367(d), mean the state limitations period is suspended during the pendency of the federal suit; or does \"tolled\" mean that, although the state limitations period continues to run, a plaintiff is accorded a grace period of 30 days to refile in state court post dismissal of the federal case?  Petitioner urges the first, or stop-the-clock, reading.  Respondent urges, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals adopted, the second, or grace-period, reading.\n",
      "     In the case before us, plaintiff-petitioner Stephanie C. Artis refiled her state-law claims in state court 59 days after dismissal of her federal suit.1  Reading §1367(d) as a grace-period prescription, her complaint would be time barred.  Reading §1367(d) as stopping the limitations clock during the pendency of the federal-court suit, her complaint would be timely.  We hold that §1367(d)'s instruction to \"toll\" a state limitations period means to hold it in abeyance, i.e., to stop the clock.  Because the D. C. Court of Appeals held that §1367(d) did not stop the D. C. Code's limitations clock, but merely provided a 30-day grace period for refiling in D. C. Superior Court, we reverse the D. C. Court of Appeals' judgment.\n",

      "     Section 1367, which Congress added to Title 28 as part of the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 5089, codifies the court-developed pendent and ancillary jurisdiction doctrines under the label \"supplemental jurisdiction.\"  See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 552-558 (2005) (describing the development of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction doctrines and subsequent enactment of §1367); id., at 579-584 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (same).  The House Report accompanying the Act explains that Congress sought to clarify the scope of federal courts' authority to hear claims within their supplemental jurisdiction, appreciating that \"[s]upplemental jurisdiction has enabled federal courts and litigants to . . . deal economically--in single rather than multiple litigation--with related matters.\"  H. R. Rep. No. 101-734, p. 28 (1990) (H. R. Rep.).  Section 1367(a) provides, in relevant part, that a district court with original jurisdiction over a claim \"shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims . . . form[ing] part of the same case or controversy.\"\n",
      "      \"[N]ot every claim within the same 'case or controversy' as the claim within the federal courts' original jurisdiction will be decided by the federal court.\"  Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 459 (2003).  Section 1367(c) states:\n",
      "     \"The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if--\n",
      "     \"(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,\n",
      "     \"(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,\n",
      "     \"(3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or\n",
      "     \"(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.\"\n",
      "     If a district court declines to exercise jurisdiction over a claim asserted under §1367(a) and the plaintiff wishes to continue pursuing it, she must refile the claim in state court.  If the state court would hold the claim time barred, however, then, absent a curative provision, the district court's dismissal of the state-law claim without prejudice would be tantamount to a dismissal with prejudice.  See, e.g., Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U. S. 343, 352 (1988) (under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, if the statute of limitations on state-law claims expires before the federal court \"relinquish[es] jurisdiction[,] . . . a dismissal will foreclose the plaintiff from litigating his claims\").  To prevent that result, §1367(d) supplies \"a tolling rule that must be applied by state courts.\"  Jinks, 538 U. S., at 459.  Section 1367(d) provides:\n",
      "\"The period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a), and for any other claim in the same action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or after the dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"\n",
      "This case requires us to determine how §1367(d)'s tolling rule operates.\n",
      "B\n",
      "     Petitioner Artis worked as a health inspector for respondent, the District of Columbia (the \"District\").  In November 2010, Artis was told she would lose her job.  Thirteen months later, Artis sued the District in the  United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that she had suffered employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq.  She also asserted three allied claims under D. C. law: retaliation in violation of the District of Columbia Whistleblower Act, D. C. Code §1-615.54 (2001); termination in violation of the District of Columbia False Claims Act, §2-381.04; and wrongful termination against public policy, a common-law claim.  Artis alleged that she had been subjected to gender discrimination by her supervisor, and thereafter encountered retaliation for reporting the supervisor's unlawful activities.  See Artis v. District of Columbia, 51 F. Supp. 3d 135, 137 (2014).\n",
      "     On June 27, 2014, the District Court granted the District's motion for summary judgment on the Title VII claim.  Having dismissed Artis' sole federal claim, the District Court, pursuant to §1367(c)(3), declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her remaining state-law claims.  \"Artis will not be prejudiced,\" the court noted, \"because 28 U. S. C. §1367(d) provides for a tolling of the statute of limitations during the period the case was here and for at least 30 days thereafter.\"  Id., at 142.\n",
      "     Fifty-nine days after the dismissal of her federal action, Artis refiled her state-law claims in the D. C. Superior Court, the appropriate local court.  The Superior Court granted the District's motion to dismiss, holding that Artis' claims were time barred, because they were filed 29 days too late.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a.  When Artis first asserted her state-law claims in the District Court, nearly two years remained on the applicable three-year statute of limitations.2  But two and a half years passed before the federal court relinquished jurisdiction.  Unless §1367(d) paused the limitations clock during that time, Artis would have had only 30 days to refile.  The Superior Court rejected Artis' stop-the-clock reading of §1367(d), reasoning that Artis could have protected her state-law claims by \"pursuing [them] in a state court while the federal court proceeding [was] pending.\"  Ibid.  In tension with that explanation, the court noted that duplicative filings in federal and state court are \"generally disfavored . . . as 'wasteful' and . . . 'against [the interests of] judicial efficiency.' \"  Id., at 14a, n. 1 (quoting Stevens v. Arco Management of Wash. D.C., Inc., 751 A. 2d 995, 1002 (D. C. 2000); alteration in original).\n",
      "     The D. C. Court of Appeals affirmed.  That court began by observing that two \"competing approaches [to §1367(d)] have evolved nationally\": the stop-the-clock reading and the grace-period reading.  135 A. 3d 334, 337 (2016).3  Without further comment on §1367(d)'s text, the D. C. Court of Appeals turned to the legislative history.  Section 1367(d)'s purpose, the court noted, was \"to prevent the loss of claims to statutes of limitations where state law might fail to toll the running of the period of limitations while a supplemental claim was pending in federal court.\"  Id., at 338 (quoting H. R. Rep., at 30; internal quotation marks omitted).  Following the lead of the California Supreme Court, the D. C. Court of Appeals determined that Congress had intended to implement a 1969 recommendation by the American Law Institute (ALI) to allow refiling in state court \"within 30 days after dismissal.\"  135 A. 3d, at 338 (quoting Los Angeles v. County of Kern, 59 Cal. 4th 618, 629, 328 P. 3d 56, 63 (2014)).\n",
      "     The D. C. Court of Appeals also concluded that the grace-period approach \"better accommodates federalism concerns,\" by trenching significantly less on state statutes of limitations than the stop-the-clock approach.  135 A. 3d, at 338-339.  Construing §1367(d) as affording only a 30-day grace period, the court commented, was \"consistent with [its] presumption favoring narrow interpretations of federal preemption of state law.\"  Id., at 339.\n",
      "     To resolve the division of opinion among State Supreme Courts on the proper construction of §1367(d), see supra, at 6, n. 3, we granted certiorari.  580 U. S. ___ (2017).\n",
      "II\n",
      "A\n",
      "     As just indicated, statutes that shelter from time bars claims earlier commenced in another forum generally employ one of two means.\n",
      "     First, the period (or statute) of limitations may be \"tolled\" while the claim is pending elsewhere.4  Ordinarily, \"tolled,\" in the context of a time prescription like §1367(d), means that the limitations period is suspended (stops running) while the claim is sub judice elsewhere, then starts running again when the tolling period ends, picking up where it left off.  See Black's Law Dictionary 1488 (6th ed. 1990) (\"toll,\" when paired with the grammatical object \"statute of limitations,\" means \"to suspend or stop temporarily\").  This dictionary definition captures the rule generally applied in federal courts.  See, e.g., Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U. S. 650, 652, n. 1 (1983) (Court's opinion \"use[d] the word 'tolling' to mean that, during the relevant period, the statute of limitations ceases to run\").5  Our decisions employ the terms \"toll\" and \"suspend\" interchangeably.  For example, in American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974), we characterized as a \"tolling\" prescription a rule \"suspend[ing] the applicable statute of limitations,\" id., at 554; accordingly, we applied the rule to stop the limitations clock, id., at 560-561.6  We have similarly comprehended what tolling means in decisions on equitable tolling.  See, e.g., CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7) (describing equitable tolling as \"a doctrine that pauses the running of, or 'tolls' a statute of limitations\" (some internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Ibarra, 502 U. S. 1, 4, n. 2 (1991) ( per curiam) (\"Principles of equitable tolling usually dictate that when a time bar has been suspended and then begins to run again upon a later event, the time remaining on the clock is calculated by subtracting from the full limitations period whatever time ran before the clock was stopped.\").\n",
      "     In lieu of \"tolling\" or \"suspending\" a limitations period by pausing its progression, a legislature might elect simply to provide a grace period.  When that mode is adopted, the statute of limitations continues to run while the claim is pending in another forum.  But the risk of a time bar is averted by according the plaintiff a fixed period in which to refile.  A federal statute of that genre is 28 U. S. C. §2415.  That provision prescribes a six-year limitations period for suits seeking money damages from the United States for breach of contract.  §2415(a).  The statute further provides: \"In the event that any action . . . is timely brought and is thereafter dismissed without prejudice, the action may be recommenced within one year after such dismissal, regardless of whether the action would otherwise then be barred by this section.\"  §2415(e).7  Many States have enacted similar grace-period provisions.  See App. to Brief for National Conference of State Legislatures et al. as Amici Curiae 1a-25a.  For example, Georgia law provides:\n",
      "\"When any case has been commenced in either a state or federal court within the applicable statute of limitations and the plaintiff discontinues or dismisses the same, it may be recommenced in a court of this state or in a federal court either within the original applicable period of limitations or within six months after the discontinuance or dismissal, whichever is later . . . .\"  Ga. Code Ann. §9-2-61(a) (2007).\n",
      "     Tellingly, the District has not identified any federal statute in which a grace-period meaning has been ascribed to the word \"tolled\" or any word similarly rooted.  Nor has the dissent, for all its mighty strivings, identified even one federal statute that fits its bill, i.e., a federal statute that says \"tolled\" but means something other than \"suspended,\" or \"paused,\" or \"stopped.\"  From what statutory text, then, does the dissent start?  See post, at 5.8 \n",
      "     Turning from statutory texts to judicial decisions, only once did an opinion of this Court employ tolling language to describe a grace period: Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536 (1989).  In Hardin, we held that, in 42 U. S. C. §1983 suits, federal courts should give effect to state statutes sheltering claims from time bars during periods of a plaintiff's legal disability.  We there characterized a state statute providing a one-year grace period as \"tolling\" or \"suspend[ing]\" the limitations period \"until one year after the disability has been removed.\"  490 U. S., at 537.  This atypical use of \"tolling\" or \"suspending\" to mean something other than stopping the clock on a limitations period is a feather on the scale against the weight of decisions in which \"tolling\" a statute of limitations signals stopping the clock.\n",
      "B\n",
      "     In determining the meaning of a statutory provision, \"we look first to its language, giving the words used their ordinary meaning.\"  Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Section 1367(d) is phrased as a tolling provision.  It suspends the statute of limitations for two adjacent time periods: while the claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days postdismissal.  Artis urges that the phrase \"shall be tolled\" in §1367(d) has the same meaning it does in the statutes cited supra, at 7, n. 4.  That is, the limitations clock stops the day the claim is filed in federal court and, 30 days postdismissal, restarts from the point at which it had stopped.\n",
      "     The District reads \"tolled\" for §1367(d)'s purposes differently.  To \"toll,\" the District urges, means to \"remove or take away an effect.\"  Brief for Respondent 12-13.  To \"toll\" a limitations period, then, would mean to \"remov[e] the bar that ordinarily would accompany its expiration.\"  Id., at 14.9  \"[T]here is nothing special,\" the District maintains, \"about tolling limitations periods versus tolling any other fact, right, or consequence.\"  Id., at 13.  But the District offers no reason why, in interpreting \"tolled\" as used in §1367(d), we should home in only on the word itself, ignoring the information about the verb's ordinary meaning gained from its grammatical object.  Just as when the object of \"tolled\" is \"bell\" or \"highway traveler,\" the object \"period of limitations\" sheds light on what it means to \"be tolled.\"\n",
      "     The District's reading, largely embraced by the dissent, is problematic for other reasons as well.  First, it tenders a strained interpretation of the phrase \"period of limitations.\"  In the District's view, \"period of limitations\" means \"the effect of the period of limitations as a time bar.\"  See id., at 18 (\"Section 1367(d) . . . provides that 'the period of limitations'--here its effect as a time bar--'shall be [removed or taken away] while the claim is pending [in federal court] and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed.' \" (alterations in original)).  Second, the first portion of the tolling period, the duration of the claim's pendency in federal court, becomes superfluous under the District's construction.  The \"effect\" of the limitations period as a time bar, on the District's reading, becomes operative only after the case has been dismissed.  That being so, what need would there be to remove anything while the claim is pending in federal court?\n",
      "     Furthermore, the District's reading could yield an absurdity: It could permit a plaintiff to refile in state court even if the limitations period on her claim had expired before she filed in federal court.  To avoid that result, the District's proposed construction of \"tolled\" as \"removed\" could not mean simply \"removed.\"  Instead, \"removed\" would require qualification to express \"removed, unless the period of limitations expired before the claim was filed in federal court.\"  In sum, the District's interpretation maps poorly onto the language of §1367(d), while Artis' interpretation is a natural fit.\n",
      "C\n",
      "     The D. C. Court of Appeals adopted the District's grace-period construction primarily because it was convinced that in drafting §1367(d), Congress embraced an ALI recommendation.  135 A. 3d, at 338.  Two decades before the enactment of §1367(d), the ALI, in its 1969 Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, did recommend a 30-day grace period for refiling certain claims.  The ALI proposed the following statutory language:\n",
      "\"If any claim in an action timely commenced in a federal court is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim, a new action on the same claim brought in another court shall not be barred by a statute of limitations that would not have barred the original action had it been commenced in that court, if such new action is brought in a proper court, federal or State, within thirty days after dismissal of the original claim has become final or within such longer period as may be available under applicable State law.\"  ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts §1386(b), p. 65 (1969) (ALI Study).\n",
      "Congress, however, did not adopt the ALI's grace-period formulation.  Instead, it ordered tolling of the state limitations period \"while the claim is pending\" in federal court.  Although the provision the ALI proposed, like §1367(d), established a 30-day federal floor on the time allowed for refiling, it did not provide for tolling the period of limitations while a claim is pending.10  True, the House Report contained a citation to the ALI Study, but only in reference to a different provision, 28 U. S. C. §1391 (the general venue statute).  There, Congress noted that its approach was \"taken from the ALI Study.\"  H. R. Rep., at 23.  Had Congress similarly embraced the ALI's grace-period formulation in §1367(d), one might expect the House Report to have said as much.11\n",
      "D\n",
      "     The District asks us to zero in on §1367(d)'s \"express inclusion\" of the \"period of 30 days after the claim is dismissed\" within the tolling period.  Brief for Respondent 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under Artis' stop-the-clock interpretation, the District contends, \"the inclusion of 30 days within the tolling period would be relegated to insignificance in the mine-run of cases.\"  Id., at 21 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  In §1367(d), Congress did provide for tolling not only while the claim is pending in federal court, but also for 30 days thereafter.  Including the 30 days within §1367(d)'s tolling period accounts for cases in which a federal action is commenced close to the expiration date of the relevant state statute of limitations.  In such a case, the added days give the plaintiff breathing space to refile in state court.\n",
      "     Adding a brief span of days to the tolling period is not unusual in stop-the-clock statutes.  In this respect, §1367(d) closely resembles 46 U. S. C. §53911, which provides, in a subsection titled \"Tolling of limitations period,\" that if a plaintiff submits a claim for war-related vessel damage to the Secretary of Transportation, \"the running of the limitations period for bringing a civil action is suspended until the Secretary denies the claim, and for 60 days thereafter.\"  §53911(d).  Numerous other statutes similarly append a fixed number of days to an initial tolling period.  See, e.g., 22 U. S. C. §1631k(c) (\"Statutes of limitations on assessments . . . shall be suspended with respect to any vested property . . . while vested and for six months thereafter. . . .\"); 26 U. S. C. §6213(f )(1) (\"In any case under title 11 of the United States Code, the running of the time prescribed by subsection (a) for filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to any deficiency shall be suspended for the period during which the debtor is prohibited by reason of such case from filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to such deficiency, and for 60 days thereafter.\"); §6503(a)(1) (\"The running of the period of limitations provided in section 6501 or 6502 . . . shall . . . be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the assessment . . . and for 60 days thereafter.\"); 50 U. S. C. §4000(c) (\"The running of a statute of limitations against the collection of tax deferred under this section . . . shall be suspended for the period of military service of the servicemember and for an additional period of 270 days thereafter.\").  Thus, the \"30 days\" provision casts no large shadow on Artis' interpretation.\n",
      "     Section 1367(d)'s proviso, \"unless State law provides for a longer tolling period,\" could similarly aid a plaintiff who filed in federal court just short of the expiration of the state limitations period.  She would have the benefit of §1367(d)'s 30-days-to-refile prescription, or such longer time as state law prescribes.12  It may be that, in most cases, the state-law tolling period will not be longer than §1367(d)'s.  But in some cases it undoubtedly will.  For example, Indiana permits a plaintiff to refile within three years of dismissal.  See Ind. Code §34-11-8-1 (2017).  And Louisiana provides that after dismissal the limitations period \"runs anew.\"  La. Civ. Code Ann., Arts. 3462, 3466 (West 2007).\n",
      "III\n",
      "     Satisfied that Artis' text-based arguments overwhelm the District's, we turn to the District's contention that the stop-the-clock interpretation of §1367(d) raises a significant constitutional question: Does the statute exceed Congress' authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, because its connection to Congress' enumerated powers is too attenuated or because it is too great an incursion on the States' domain?  Brief for Respondent 46-49.  To avoid constitutional doubt, the District urges, we should adopt its reading.  \"[W]here an alternative interpretation of [a] statute is fairly possible,\" the District reminds, we have construed legislation in a manner that \"avoid[s] [serious constitutional] problems\" raised by \"an otherwise acceptable construction.\"  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 299-300 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But even if we regarded the District's reading of §1367(d) as \"fairly possible,\" our precedent would undermine the proposition that §1367(d) presents a serious constitutional problem.  See Jinks, 538 U. S., at 461-465.\n",
      "     In Jinks, we unanimously rejected an argument that §1367(d) impermissibly exceeds Congress' enumerated powers.13  Section 1367(d), we held, \"is necessary and proper for carrying into execution Congress's power '[t]o constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court,' . . . and to assure that those tribunals may fairly and efficiently exercise '[t]he judicial Power of the United States.' \"  Id., at 462 (quoting U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 9, and Art. III, §1).\n",
      "     In two principal ways, we explained, §1367(d) is \"conducive to the due administration of justice in federal court.\"  538 U. S., at 462 (internal quotation marks omitted).  First, \"it provides an alternative to the unsatisfactory options that federal judges faced when they decided whether to retain jurisdiction over supplemental state-law claims that might be time barred in state court.\"  Ibid.  Section 1367(d) thus \"unquestionably promotes fair and efficient operation of the federal courts.\"  Id., at 463.  Second, §1367(d) \"eliminates a serious impediment to access to the federal courts on the part of plaintiffs pursuing federal- and state-law claims\" arising from the same episode.  Ibid.  With tolling available, a plaintiff disinclined to litigate simultaneously in two forums is no longer impelled to choose between forgoing either her federal claims or her state claims.\n",
      "     Moreover, we were persuaded that §1367(d) was \"plainly adapted\" to Congress' exercise of its enumerated power: there was no cause to suspect that Congress had enacted §1367(d) as a \" 'pretext' for 'the accomplishment of objects not entrusted to [it],' \"; nor was there reason to believe that the connection between §1367(d) and Congress' authority over the federal courts was too attenuated.  Id., at 464 (quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 423 (1819)).\n",
      "     Our decision in Jinks also rejected the argument that §1367(d) was not \"proper\" because it violates principles of state sovereignty by prescribing a procedural rule for state courts' adjudication of purely state-law claims.  538 U. S., at 464-465.  \"Assuming [without deciding] that a principled dichotomy can be drawn, for purposes of determining whether an Act of Congress is 'proper,' between federal laws that regulate state-court 'procedure' and laws that change the 'substance' of state-law rights of action,\" we concluded that the tolling of state limitations periods \"falls on the [permissible] 'substantive' side of the line.\"  Ibid.\n",
      "     The District's contention that a stop-the-clock prescription serves \"no federal purpose\" that could not be served by a grace-period prescription is unavailing.  Brief for Respondent 49.  Both devices are standard, off-the-shelf means of accounting for the fact that a claim was timely pressed in another forum.  Requiring Congress to choose one over the other would impose a tighter constraint on Congress' discretion than we have ever countenanced.\n",
      "     The concern that a stop-the-clock prescription entails a greater imposition on the States than a grace-period prescription, moreover, may be more theoretical than real.  Consider the alternative suggested by the D. C. Superior Court.  Plaintiffs situated as Artis was could simply file two actions and ask the state court to hold the suit filed there in abeyance pending disposition of the federal suit.  See supra, at 6.  Were the dissent's position to prevail, cautious plaintiffs would surely take up the D. C. Superior Court's suggestion.  How it genuinely advances federalism concerns to drive plaintiffs to resort to wasteful, inefficient duplication to preserve their state-law claims is far from apparent.  See, e.g., Stevens, 751 A. 2d, at 1002 (it \"work[s] against judicial efficiency . . . to compel prudent federal litigants who present state claims to file duplicative and wasteful protective suits in state court\").\n",
      "     We do not gainsay that statutes of limitations are \"fundamental to a well-ordered judicial system.\"  Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U. S. 478, 487 (1980).  We note in this regard, however, that a stop-the-clock rule is suited to the primary purposes of limitations statutes: \"preventing surprises\" to defendants and \"barring a plaintiff who has slept on his rights.\"  American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 554 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Whenever §1367(d) applies, the defendant will have notice of the plaintiff's claims within the state-prescribed limitations period.  Likewise, the plaintiff will not have slept on her rights.  She will have timely asserted those rights, endeavoring to pursue them in one litigation.\n",
      "*  *  *\n",
      "     For the reasons stated, we resist unsettling the usual understanding of the word \"tolled\" as it appears in legislative time prescriptions and court decisions thereon.  The judgment of the D. C. Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n",

      "     Chesterton reminds us not to clear away a fence just because we cannot see its point.  Even if a fence doesn't seem to have a reason, sometimes all that means is we need to look more carefully for the reason it was built in the first place.\n",
      "     The same might be said about the law before us.  Section 1367(d) provides that \"[t]he period of limitations . . . shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"  28 U. S. C. §1367(d).  Grown from a rich common law and state statutory tradition, this provision serves a modest role.  If a federal court dismisses a party's state law claim without ruling on its merits, the law ensures the party will enjoy whatever time state law allows, or at least 30 days, to refile the claim in state court.\n",
      "     Today the Court clears away this traditional rule because it overlooks the original reasons for it.  For the first time in the statute's history the Court now reads the law to guarantee parties not 30 days or whatever state law permits but months or years more to refile their dismissed state law claims in state court.  Rather than reading the statute as generally deferring to state law judgments about the appropriate lifespan of state law claims brought in state courts, the Court now reads the statute as generally displacing them in favor of a new federal rule.  Indeed, the Court today tells state courts that they must routinely disregard clearly expressed state law defining the appropriate length of time parties should have to sue on state law claims in state tribunals.  Under the Court's rule, too, the disregard of state limitations law promises to be not only routine but substantial.  The Court's approach will require state courts to entertain state law claims that state law deems untimely not only by weeks or months but by many years, as 24 States, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments warn us.  And the Court demands all this without offering any rational account why it is necessary or proper to the exercise of one of the federal government's limited and enumerated powers.  It may only be a small statute we are interpreting, but the result the Court reaches today represents no small intrusion on traditional state functions and no small departure from our foundational principles of federalism.  Respectfully, I dissent.\n",
      "     Start with the statute's key term.  Where, as here, a law instructs us to \"toll\" a limitations period, we know it may be telling us to do one of (at least) two different things.  The dictionary informs that to \"toll\" means \"[t]o take away, bar, defeat, [or] annul.\"  See 18 Oxford English Dictionary 204 (2d ed. 1989); Webster's New International Dictionary 2662 (2d ed. 1957) (\"[t]o take away; to vacate; to annul\"); Oxford Latin Dictionary 1947 (1982) (\"tollere,\" the Latin origin, means to \"remove\" or \"lift\").  So when a statute speaks of tolling a limitations period it can, naturally enough, mean either that the running of the limitations period is suspended or that the effect of the limitations period is defeated.  The first understanding stops the limitations clock running until a specified event begins it running again: call it the stop clock approach.  The second understanding allows the limitations clock to continue to run but defeats the effect of the clock's expiration for an additional specified period of time: call it the grace period approach.\n",
      "     That both of these understandings of the word \"toll\" are indeed possible and in fact historically common this Court has already explained in Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U. S. 650 (1983):\n",
      "\" 'Tolling effect' refers to the method of calculating the amount of time available to file suit after tolling has ended.  The statute of limitations might merely be suspended; if so, the plaintiff must file within the amount of time left in the limitations period. . . .  It is also possible to establish a fixed period such as six months or one year during which the plaintiff may file suit, without regard to the length of the original limitations period or the amount of time left when tolling began.\"  Id., at 652, n. 1 (emphasis added).\n",
      "When it comes to federal law today, Chardon has further explained, both kinds of tolling can be found.  \"[S]ome federal statutes provide for suspension\" of the running of the limitations period, or the stop clock approach, while \"other statutes establish a variety of different tolling effects,\" including grace periods for refiling after dismissal.  Id., at 660, n. 13.\n",
      "     Neither is it a surprise that Chardon acknowledged tolling statutes might come in (at least) these two varieties.  At common law, both types of tolling were well and long known, if often employed in different circumstances to address different problems in equitably tailored ways.\n",
      "     Take the stop clock approach.  While any generalization is subject to its exceptions, the stop clock approach was often used at common law to suspend a plaintiff's duty to bring a timely lawsuit if, and for the period, the plaintiff was prevented from coming to court due to some disability.  And this common law rule made common sense in those circumstances.  After all, if (say) a defendant's fraud prevented the plaintiff from discovering his injury, it's easy enough to see why the limitations clock should stop running until the fraud is revealed and the disability thus dissipated.1\n",
      "     By contrast, the grace period approach was commonly used in cases where, as here, the plaintiff made it to court in time but arrived in the wrong court and had to refile in the right one.  In this situation, equity didn't necessarily call for suspending the running of the limitations period for whatever arbitrary period of time--weeks or months or years--the suit happened to sit in court before dismissal.  It's not as if the defendant or uncontrollable circumstances had conspired to prevent the plaintiff from proceeding during that period.  Instead, the law commonsensically held that in these circumstances a grace period would suffice to allow the plaintiff a brief time to find his way to and refile in the correct court.2\n",
      "     Indeed, grace periods appear to find their roots in a common law rule known as the \"journey's account\" that expressly sought to account for and afford to a dismissed party \"the number of days which [he] must spend in journeying to the court\" to refile his claim.  37 C. J., Limitations of Actions §526, p. 1082 (1925); see E. Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 567 (1642) (reprint 1797) (\"[T]he common law set downe the certaine time of 15 dayes,\" because \"a dayes journey is accounted in law 20 miles,\" as \"a  reasonable time . . . within which time wheresoever the court of justice sate in England, the party . . . wheresoever he dwelt in England . . . might . . . by the said account of dayes journies appeare in court\"); Spencer's Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 267, 267-268 (1603) (party has \"the benefit of a new writ by journeys accompts\" after first writ \"abated\"); Elstob v. Thorowgood, 91 Eng. Rep. 1086, 1087 (1697) (party has 30 days to bring an action \"by journeys account\" to avoid \"the Statute of Limitations\").\n",
      "     When it comes to the statute before us, the textual and contextual clues point in the same and unsurprising direction.  Much like the journey's account from which it originated, section 1367(d)'s \"tolling\" provision seeks to provide the plaintiff who finds her case dismissed because she filed in the wrong court a reasonable grace period to journey to the right court to refile.  No more and no less.\n",
      "     Take the textual clues.  Section 1367(d) says that \"the period of limitations . . . shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.\"  Note that the law uses the words \"tolled\" and \"tolling\" in the same sentence.  Normally, we assume that when Congress repeats a term in a statute the term's meaning remains constant throughout.  And that assumption is surely \"at its most vigorous\" where, as here, Congress repeats the same term in the same sentence.  Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n",
      "     This traditional rule of construction tells us a great deal. It does because no one doubts that the state law \"tolling period[s]\" referenced in the second half of the sentence were at the time of section 1367(d)'s enactment--and still are--grace periods allowing parties a specified number of days or months after dismissal to refile in the proper court.  See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. §13-80-111 (1990) (providing that the plaintiff \"may commence a new action upon the same cause of action within ninety days after the termination of the original action\").3  In fact, these statutes were often self-consciously patterned on the journey's account doctrine, seeking to address much the same problem the common law faced with much the same solution.4  And the fact that Congress used a variant of the word \"toll\" in the second half of the sentence to refer to grace periods strongly suggests it did so in the first half of the sentence too.  So that the first phrase \"shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days\" should be understood to extend a grace period of 30 days after dismissal much as the second phrase \"tolling period\" is understood to refer the reader to parallel state law grace periods affording short periods for refiling after dismissal.\n",
      "     The alternative reading endorsed by the Court today extends too little respect to Congress's competency as drafter.  It asks us to assume the legislature was so garbled in its expression that it switched the meaning of the term \"toll\" halfway through a single sentence without telling anyone.  It asks us to conclude that when Congress spoke of the period \"tolled\" in the first part of the sentence it meant to refer (unambiguously, no less) to a stop clock approach even though it used the term \"tolling period\" to refer to existing state law grace periods in the second part of the sentence.  The statute's text drops no hint of such a silent switch and it's a lexicographical leap our traditional rules of statutory interpretation warn against.\n",
      "     That, though, represents just the beginning of the textual troubles with the approach the Court adopts.  Consider next the fact that section 1367(d) tells us to apply its federal tolling rule \"unless\" state law provides a \"longer tolling period.\"  In this way, the statute asks us to compare the length of the state \"tolling period\" with the length of the federal \"tolling period\" set by section 1367(d) and apply the longer one.  See ante, at 16 (courts apply the federal rule if \"the state-law tolling period will not be longer than §1367(d)'s\").  The equation we're asked to perform is straightforward and sensible if we understand both the state and federal \"tolling periods\" discussed in this statute as grace periods.  We simply pick the longer grace period: is it the federal 30 day period or one provided by state law?\n",
      "     By contrast, the equation is anything but straightforward or sensible under the Court's approach.  The Court tells us that, under its reading of the statute, the federal \"tolling period\" is the \"duration of the claim's pendency in federal court\" plus 30 days.  See ante, at 12, 15.  So the decision whether to apply the federal or the state tolling period turns not on the sensible question which would afford the plaintiff more time to refile but instead on the happenstance of how long the plaintiff's claim sat in federal court before dismissal.  Under the Court's interpretation, we apply the federal stop clock rule if, but only if, the time the case happened to linger in federal court before dismissal (plus 30 days) is longer than the relevant state grace period.  But to state the test is to see it is a nonsense--one we would not lightly attribute to any rational drafter, let alone Congress.\n",
      "     Consider some examples of the absurdities that follow from the apples-to-oranges comparison the Court's test requires.  Say state law provides a 5 year statute of limitations and a 1 year grace period for refiling.  The plaintiff files in federal court one day before the statute of limitations expires.  The litigation in federal court lasts 1 year.  Under the Court's view, the federal \"tolling period\" would be 1 year plus 30 days--the time the claim was pending in federal court plus 30 days after dismissal.  That period is longer than the state tolling period of 1 year and so the federal tolling rule, not the state rule, controls--leaving the plaintiff only 31 days to refile her claim after dismissal even though state law would have allowed a full year.\n",
      "     That may be curious enough, but curiouser it gets.  Now suppose the litigation in federal court lasts only 10 months.  That makes the federal tolling period only 11 months (10 months plus 30 days).  Under the Court's view, state law now provides a longer tolling period (1 year) and the litigant gets a full year to refile in state court instead of 31 days.  No one has offered a reason why the happenstance of how long the federal litigation lasted should determine how much time a litigant has to refile in state court.  Yet that is what the Court's reading of section 1367(d) demands.\n",
      "     Of course, it's easy enough to imagine the rule the Court really wants to adopt today: it would like to afford litigants as a matter of federal law the benefit of a stop clock approach whenever doing so would yield more time to refile than the state's grace period would permit.  But to accomplish so much we would need a very different statute than the one we have.  We would need to be able to compare the relevant state law grace \"tolling period\" not with the federal \"tolling period\" as the statute says but with the amount of time left under the relevant state limitations period on the date the plaintiff filed her federal suit.  The problem is, no one has even hinted how we might lawfully superimpose all those italicized words (entirely of our own devise) onto the statutory text.5\n",
      "     There are still more textual clues that we have lost our way today.  Congress spoke of the federal tolling period as embracing \"30 days after . . . dismissal.\"  That language sounds like and fits with a traditional grace period or journey's account approach.  As we've seen, grace periods often speak about affording parties some short period of time after dismissal to refile their claims.  Meanwhile, this language proves no small challenge to square with a stop clock approach.  Generally we say a clock is stopped due to the onset of a particular event like a disability: something usually causes the stopping of the clock and when that something goes away, the clock restarts.  Here, the Court says, the clock stops once a claim is pending in federal court.  Yet it doesn't restart when that something--the claim's pendency--goes away but instead waits another 30 days before ticking again.  All without any apparent reason for the additional delay.\n",
      "     This case illustrates the oddity.  The petitioner filed her suit in federal court with 23 months remaining on the three year statute of limitations.  The case remained in federal district court for nearly three years before dismissal.  Under the grace period approach the 30 day provision does just as it appears, providing petitioner with 30 days to journey to and refile in the correct court.  Under the stop clock approach, though, the statute affords the petitioner 23 months plus a random 30 days more to refile.  Indeed, on the stop clock approach the only work the 30 day period is even imaginably left to do comes in cases where the plaintiff filed her federal suit at the very end of the limitations period.  And if that's the only problem Congress sought to address, it chose a mighty murky way to do it, for the parties point to not a single stop clock provision in all of federal law that includes language anything like this.  All while (again) this language fits hand in glove with every grace period statute known.6\n",
      "     Beyond all these textual clues lie important contextual ones too.  When Congress replants the roots of preexisting law in the federal code, this Court assumes it brings with it the surrounding soil, retaining the substance of the tradition it engages.  Respect for Congress, this Court has held, means assuming it knows and \"legislate[s] against a background of [the] common law . . . principles\" found in the field where it is working.  Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U. S. 305, 320, n. 13 (2010); see also Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U. S. 174, 184-185 (1988).  And, as we've seen, the state law of tolling Congress expressly referenced and replanted in section 1367(d) comes heavily encrusted with meaning.  In cases involving dismissal and refiling, state statutory law and the common law from which it grew have long afforded a grace period to allow the litigant an appropriately tailored time to find his way to the proper court.  Meanwhile, a stop clock approach isn't usually part of this ecosystem for nothing has disabled the litigant from reaching a court in the first place and all he must do is journey from the old court to the new one.  We don't assume Congress strips replanted statutes of their soil, and we should not assume Congress displaced so much tradition in favor of something comparatively foreign.7\n",
      "     The Court's reformation of the statute introduces another problem still--one of significantly greater magnitude yet.  In our constitutional structure, the federal government's powers are supposed to be \"few and defined,\" while the powers reserved to the States \"remain . . . numerous and indefinite.\"  The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (Madison); McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819).  No doubt, the Constitution affords Congress the authority to make laws that are \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its defined duties.  Art. I, §8, cl. 18.  But it is difficult to see how, on the Court's interpretation, section 1367(d) might be said to survive that test--how it might be said to be necessary and proper to effectuate any recognized federal power or how it could be called anything other than an unconstitutional intrusion on the core state power to define the terms of state law claims litigated in state court proceedings.8\n",
      "     Under our precedent, the analysis here begins with Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456 (2003).  Without some tolling rule for dismissed state law supplemental claims, the Court in Jinks noted, federal courts would be left with \"three basic choices:\" (1) \"condition dismissal of the state-law claim on the defendant's waiver of any statute-of-limitations defense in state court\"; (2) \"retain jurisdiction over the state-law claim even though it would more appropriately be heard in state court\"; or (3) \"dismiss the state-law claim but allow the plaintiff to reopen the fed-eral case if the state court later held the claim to be time barred.\"  Id., at 462-463.  All three choices, the Court held, would negatively affect the \" 'administration of justice' in federal court\" and thus impair the exercise of the enumerated \"judicial power\" of the federal government in Article III.  Id., at 462 (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the Court reasoned, some tolling rule \"assur[ing] that state-law claims asserted under [the supplemental jurisdiction statute] will not become time barred while pending in federal court\" is necessary and proper to the execution of the federal judicial power.  Id., at 464.\n",
      "      The necessary and proper federal interest Jinks recognized is fully discharged by a grace period.  Even petitioner appears to concede this.  See Brief for Petitioner 27 (\"Of course, the grace period approach also guarantees a plaintiff who is unsuccessful in federal court the opportunity to bring a claim in state court\").  Nor could anyone easily argue otherwise.  Jinks itself proceeded to uphold the constitutionality of section 1367(d) as necessary and proper on the basis of an understanding that the statute guaranteed just 30 days to a disappointed litigant to refile in state court.  No one in Jinks even hinted that a longer period might be necessary or proper to serve any valid federal interest.9\n",
      "     For good reason, it turns out.  Trying to imagine how the Court's novel twist on section 1367(d) might serve a necessary and proper federal interest is a hard business.  To discharge the federal interest in preventing state law claims from \"becom[ing] time barred while pending in federal court\" it may be necessary to impose a short grace period.  But how is it necessary to do anything more than that, like consult the happenstance of how long the federal court took to dismiss the case and then tack an equivalent number of months or years onto state law limitations periods?  What federal interest could that even plausibly serve?  The Court does not and cannot attempt an answer because its proffered solution is simply orthogonal to any federal concern.\n",
      "     To be sure, the Court suggests that its approach will help the States.  See ante, at 19.  But a great many States have suggested the opposite, complaining to us that the Court's approach will regularly relegate to the dustbin their own state limitations policy choices.  See Brief for State of Wisconsin et al. as Amici Curiae 22-27; Brief for National Conference of State Legislatures et al. as Amici Curiae 6-29.  And surely they would seem better positioned than we to know their own interests.  To this, the Court replies that \"[w]ere the dissent's position to prevail, cautious plaintiffs would surely\" file \"two actions [one in federal, the other in state court] and ask the state court to hold the suit filed there in abeyance pending disposition of the federal suit,\" causing \"plaintiffs to resort to wasteful, inefficient duplication.\"  Ante, at 19.  But, of course, this observation does nothing to tell us whether stop clock tolling is necessary to serve a federal interest.  Nor does it even tell us whether stop clock tolling is necessary to help the States.  A very long historical record before us suggests that grace periods have worked well to obviate the need for simultaneous filings in state and federal court; the Court offers no account why its innovation might be needed only now to rescue States from their own legislative choices about the appropriate lifespan of their state law claims.\n",
      "     The Court's approach isn't just unnecessary; it isn't proper either.  A law is not \"proper for carrying into [e]xecution\" an enumerated power if it \"violates the principle of state sovereignty\" reflected in our constitutional tradition.  Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 923-924 (1997).  The word \"proper\" was \"used during the founding era to describe the powers of a governmental entity as peculiarly within the province or jurisdiction of that entity.\"  Lawson & Granger, The \"Proper\" Scope of Federal Power: A Jurisdictional Interpretation of the Sweeping Clause, 43 Duke L. J. 267, 297 (1993).  Limitations periods for state law claims fall well within the peculiar province of state sovereign authority.  As Chancellor Kent explained, \" '[t]he period sufficient to constitute a bar to the litigation of sta[l]e demands, is a question of municipal policy and regulation, and one which belongs to the discretion of every government, consulting its own interest and convenience.' \"  Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717, 726 (1988) (quoting 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 462-463 (2d ed. 1832)).  Described as \"laws for administering justice,\" time bars are \"one of the most sacred and important of sovereign rights and duties.\"  Hawkins v. Barney's Lessee, 5 Pet. 457, 466 (1831).  And \"from a remote antiquity,\" they have been the province of the sovereign \"by which it exercises its legislation for all persons and property within its jurisdiction.\"  McElmoyle ex rel. Bailey v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312, 327 (1839).  Our States have long \"exercise[d] this right in virtue of their sovereignty.\"  Ibid.\n",
      "     The decision today gives short shrift to these traditional interests.  Just consider how differently the two approaches treat States when it comes to one of their most \"important of sovereign rights.\"  Under a grace period approach, Congress simply fills a void, for the great bulk of States provide for grace periods of 30 days or longer; only a few States don't allow that much or don't speak to the question.  See n. 3, supra.  So on the grace period account, Congress provides a modest backstop consistent with existing state law.  By contrast, under the stop clock interpretation, state law grace periods are displaced whenever the federal litigation (plus those odd 30 days) happens to be longer than the state law grace period.  And that, of course, is sure to happen often, for federal litigation is no quick business and state law grace periods often are.  Any time federal litigation (plus, again, 30 days) lasts longer than the 30 or 60 or 90 or 365 day grace period found in state law, state law will be forced to give way, and a federally mandated stop clock approach will usurp its place.\n",
      "     The stop clock approach, then, ensures that traditional state law judgments about the appropriate lifespan of state law claims will be routinely displaced--and displaced in favor of nothing more than a fortuity (the time a claim sits in federal court) that bears no rational relationship to any federal interest.  The Court's approach forces state courts to entertain routinely state law claims that the state legislatures treat as no claims at all.  And it forces state courts to entertain claims that aren't just stale by days or weeks under state law, but stale by months or even many years too.  So, for example, take a plaintiff who files suit in federal court shortly after a six year state law limitations period begins running and the litigation lasts six years before it's finally dismissed.  Under the Court's approach, federal law will now promise the plaintiff nearly six years more (plus those stray 30 days again) to refile his claim in state court.  Neither is this illustration fiction; it is drawn from the facts of Berke v. Buckley Broadcasting Corp., 821 A. 2d 118, 121 (N. J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2003).  See also Krause v. Textron Fin. Corp., 2007 WL 8054628, *1-2 (Fla. Cir. Ct. 2007); Brief for State of Wisconsin et al. as Amici Curiae 20-21 (offering many more examples).  Given all this, it's no wonder that 24 States, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments complain that the result the Court reaches today flies in the face of federalism.10\n",
      "     The Court today clears away a fence that once marked a basic boundary between federal and state power.  Maybe it wasn't the most vital fence and maybe we've just simply forgotten why this particular fence was built in the first place.  But maybe, too, we've forgotten because we've wandered so far from the idea of a federal government of limited and enumerated powers that we've begun to lose sight of what it looked like in the first place.  If the federal government can now, without any rational reason, force States to allow state law causes of action in state courts even though the state law limitations period expired many years ago, what exactly can't it do to override the application of state law to state claims in state court?  What boundaries remain then?\n",

      "Footnote 4 Among illustrations: 21 U. S. C. §1604 (allowing suits to proceed against certain biomaterial providers and providing that \"[a]ny applicable statute of limitations shall toll during the period from the time a claimant files a petition with the Secretary under this paragraph until such time as either (i) the Secretary issues a final decision on the petition, or (ii) the petition is withdrawn,\" §1604(b)(3)(C)); 28 U. S. C. §1332 (permitting the removal of \"mass actions\" to federal court and providing that \"[t]he limitations periods on any claims asserted in a mass action that is removed to Federal court pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed tolled during the period that the action is pending in Federal court,\" §1332(d)(11)(D)); 42 U. S. C. §233 (providing a remedy against the United States for certain injuries caused by employees of the Public Health Service, and stating that \"[t]he time limit for filing a claim under this subsection . . . shall be tolled during the pendency of a[n] [administrative] request for benefits,\" §233(p)(3) (A)(ii)).  See also Wis. Stat. §893.15(3) (2011-2012) (\"A Wisconsin law limiting the time for commencement of an action on a Wisconsin cause of action is tolled from the period of commencement of the action in a non-Wisconsin forum until the time of its final disposition in that forum.\").  The dissent maintains that \"stop clock examples [from the U. S. Code] often involve situations where some disability prevents the plaintiff from proceeding to court.\"  Post, at 12, n. 7.  Plainly, however, the several statutes just set out do not fit that description: They do not involve \"disabilities.\"  Instead, like §1367(d), they involve claims earlier commenced in another forum.\n",
      "Footnote 5 As we recognized in Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U. S. 650 (1983), there may be different ways of \"calculating the amount of time available to file suit after tolling has ended.\"  Id., at 652, n. 1 (emphasis added).  In addition to the \"common-law\" stop-the-clock effect, id., at 655, under which the plaintiff must file within the amount of time left in the limitations period, a statute might either provide for the limitations period to be \"renewed,\" so that \"the plaintiff has the benefit of a new period as long as the original,\" or \"establish a fixed period such as six months or one year during which the plaintiff may file suit, without regard to the length of the original limitations period or the amount of time left when tolling began.\"  Id., at 652, n. 1.  Notably, under each of the \"tolling effect[s]\" enumerated in Chardon, ibid., the word \"tolled\" means that the progression of the limitations clock is stopped for the duration of \"tolling.\"\n",
      "Footnote 6 The dissent's notion that federal tolling periods may be understood as grace periods, not stop-the-clock periods, see post, at 7-8, is entirely imaginative.\n",
      "Footnote 7 Also illustrative, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prescribes a five-year limitations period for certain suits.  15 U. S. C. §1691e(f ).  Where a government agency has brought a timely suit, however, an individual may bring an action \"not later than one year after the commencement of that proceeding or action.\"  Ibid.\n",
      "Footnote 8 Reasons of history, context, and policy, the dissent maintains, would have made it sensible for Congress to have written a grace-period statute.  See post, at 4-5.  But \"[t]he controlling principle in this case is the basic and unexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written[,] . . . giving each word its ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\"  Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n",
      "Footnote 9 This is indeed a definition sometimes used in reference to a right.  See, e.g., Ricard v. Williams, 7 Wheat. 59, 120 (1822) (\"[A]n adverse possession . . . toll[s] the right of entry of the heirs, and, consequently, extinguish[es], by the lapse of time, their right of action for the land.\").  See also Black's Law Dictionary 1488 (6th ed. 1990) (\"toll\" can mean \"bar, defeat, or take away; thus, to toll the entry means to deny or take away the right of entry\").  The dissent, also relying on this sense of the word \"toll,\" cites Chardon as support for the proposition that §1367(d)'s tolling instruction is ambiguous.  See post, at 3; supra, at 8, n. 5.  But, importantly, the grace-period statutes noted in Chardon, 462 U. S., at 660, n. 13, were precise about their operation.  Chardon provides no support for the notion that a statute's instruction that a \"period of limitations shall be tolled\" plausibly could mean that the limitations clock continues to run but its effect as a bar is removed during the tolling.  See post, at 2-3.\n",
      "Footnote 10 The District emphasizes that the Reporter's note accompanying the ALI's proposed statute stated: \"[A]ny governing statute of limitations is tolled by the commencement of an action in a federal court, and for at least thirty days following dismissal . . . in any case in which the dismissal was for lack of jurisdiction.\"  ALI Study 66.  The similarity between this language and §1367(d), the District argues, rebuts any argument that Congress did not adopt the ALI's recommendation.  We are unpersuaded.  The District offers no explanation why, if Congress wanted to follow the substance of the ALI's grace-period recommendation, it would neither cite the ALI Study in the legislative history of §1367(d), see infra this page, nor adopt the precise language of either the proposed statute or the Reporter's note.  The ALI Study, moreover, cautions that the Reporter's notes reflect \"the Reporter's work alone,\" not a position taken by the Institute.  ALI Study, p. x.\n",
      "Footnote 11 The dissent offers a history lesson on the ancient common-law principle of \"journey's account,\" see post, at 5-6, and n. 4, but nothing suggests that the 101st Congress had any such ancient law in mind when it drafted §1367(d).  Cf. post, at 9.  More likely, Congress was mindful that \"suspension\" during the pendency of other litigation is \"the common-law rule.\"  Chardon, 462 U. S., at 655.\n",
      "Footnote 12 The dissent, post, at 8-9, conjures up absurdities not presented by this case, for the District of Columbia has no law of the kind the dissent describes.  All agree that the phrase \"unless State law provides for a longer tolling period\" leaves room for a more generous state-law regime.  The dissent posits a comparison between the duration of the federal suit, plus 30 days, and a state-law grace period.  But of course, as the dissent recognizes, post, at 9, the more natural comparison is between the amount of time a plaintiff has left to refile, given the benefit of §1367(d)'s tolling rule, and the amount of time she would have to refile under the applicable state law.  Should the extraordinary circumstances the dissent envisions in fact exist in a given case, the comparison the dissent makes would be far from inevitable.\n",
      "Footnote 13 The dissent refers to an \"understanding,\" post, at 14, by the Court in Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456 (2003), that §1367(d) accords only a 30-day \"window\" for refiling in state court.  Scattered characterizations in the Jinks briefing might be seen as conveying that understanding.  See post, at 14, n. 9.  The opinion itself, however, contains nary a hint of any such understanding.  And indeed, one year earlier, we described §1367(d) as having the effect of stopping the clock, i.e., \"toll[ing] the state statute of limitations for 30 days in addition to however long the claim had been pending in federal court.\"  Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533, 542 (2002).\n",

      "Footnote 5 In footnote 12 of its opinion, the Court suggests that a comparison between state and federal tolling periods may not be \"inevitable\" and that in \"extraordinary circumstances\" like those discussed above a comparison between the state tolling period and the time left on the clock before the federal filing might prove \"more natural.\"  Ante, at 16, n. 12.  But even here the Court does not attempt to explain how the latter comparison might be fairly extracted from the statutory text--let alone only in \"extraordinary circumstances.\"\n",
      "Footnote 6 The Court offers a couple of competing textual arguments but neither can bear much weight.\n",
      "First, the Court suggests that deriving a grace period from the statutory term \"period of limitations\" requires \"strain[ing].\"  Ante, at 12.  But the fact is both the grace period and stop clock interpretations require some (and some very similar) inferences.  The grace period approach construes the term \"period of limitations\" as directing us to the \"effect of the period of limitations\" that is tolled or taken away.  For its part meanwhile, the stop clock approach construes \"period of limitations\" to refer to the \"running of the period of limitations\" that is tolled or taken away.  The question is which inference is more persuasive.  And in light of the dual kinds of tolling the law has long recognized, as well as the textual and contextual clues before us (some still to be discussed), the better answer is clear.\n",
      "Second, the Court complains that the grace period interpretation renders \"superfluous\" the phrase \"while the claim is pending.\"  Ante, at 12.  But the phrase does important work under the grace period approach, ensuring that the expiration of limitations period does not take effect while the claim is pending in federal court.  Indeed and somewhat paradoxically, the Court itself implicitly recognizes that the language does real work when it suggests (in its next sentence no less) that the grace period approach could \"yield an absurdity\" by working to revive a claim that has already expired before it is brought in federal court.  Ante, at 12-13.  There is of course no absurdity in it, for the term \"while the claim is pending\" does the important work of addressing that very concern, preventing the expiration of the statute of limitations from taking effect while the claim is pending even as the language also and sensibly permits the statute of limitations to take effect if it expires before the plaintiff files his claim in federal court.\n",
      "Footnote 7 The Court dismisses this \"history lesson\" on the ground that it doesn't know if Congress had \"the ancient common-law . . . in mind.\"  Ante, at 14, n. 11.  But respect for Congress's competency means we presume it knows the substance of the state laws it expressly incorporates into its statutes and the common law against which it operates.  See supra, at 11.  When the Court turns to offer its own competing contextual evidence, it observes that a stop clock approach can be found in many other places in the U. S. Code.  See ante, at 7, and n. 4, 15-16.  But it turns out the Court's stop clock examples often involve situations where some disability prevents the plaintiff from proceeding to court.  See, e.g., 26 U. S. C. §6213(f )(1) (limitations period for filing a petition in the Tax Court \"shall be suspended for the period during which the debtor is prohibited . . . from filing a petition\"); §6503(a)(1) (limitations period on making an assessment shall \"be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the assessment\").  Notably, not one of the Court's examples purports to address a situation like the one we face: where the plaintiff has proven able to come to court but merely chosen the wrong one.  The Court's own contextual evidence, then, serves to illustrate just how unusual and out of place a stop clock approach would be here.\n",
      "Footnote 8 Of course, the case before us arises from litigation in the District of Columbia where the federal government enjoys plenary power.  See Art. I, §8, cl. 17.  But the federalism concern here cannot be ignored, as the Court today rightly acknowledges (ante, at 16-19), because the statute at issue applies nationwide and the vast bulk of its applications come in the States and implicate state causes of action, state limitations laws, and state court proceedings.\n",
      "Footnote 9 See Brief for Petitioner in Jinks v. Richland County, O.T. 2002, No. 02-258, p. 9 (\"The tolling window created lasts only 30 days after dismissal without prejudice from district court[.]\"); id., at 37 (section 1367(d) \"provides a de minimis window in which a plaintiff may refile in state court if the limitations period expires during the pendency of the federal district court action\"); Brief for Respondent in No. 02-258, p. 31 (describing section 1367(d) as providing \"a thirty-day tolling window\"); Brief for United States in No. 02-258, pp. 16, 22 (describing section 1367(d) as \"minimally intrusive on state prerogatives\" since it ensures that the \"statute of limitations on the pendent claim will not expire during the pendency of the federal-court action\"); Pet. for Cert. in No. 02-258, p. 22 (\"Section 1367(d) merely saves--for a maximum excess period of 30 days--a preexisting lawsuit that must be refiled to allow the matter to be heard in a forum preferable to the State, namely, in its own courts\"); see also Brief for State of Wisconsin et al. as Amici Curiae 8-9.\n",
      "Footnote 10 The Court's reply--that stop clock tolling is \"standard\" and \"off-the-shelf \"--is no answer.  Ante, at 19.  The propriety of a legal tool in one area does not establish its propriety in all; while stop clock tolling may be standard and off-the-shelf in other contexts (such as for equitable tolling) that doesn't mean it is necessary and proper here.  Indeed, and as we've seen, the \"standard\" and \"off-the-shelf\" solution to the problem of dismissal and the need to refile is the one adopted at common law and by state law: a grace period.  If we're interested in looking for the right shelf, that's the one.\n",
